of Cardholders and Billing Officials</h2>
      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. Nomination, selection, and appointment of BOs
and CHs are in accordance with DoD Charge Card Guidebook Chapters
A.1.1 and A.3. A/OPCs must receive written and signed approval from
the BO/CH’s supervisory chain of command before initiating
their appointment process. BOs should be in the supervisory chain
of command of the CH.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. Army BOs will receive both Approving/Billing
Official and Certifying Officer appointments. Army BOs both approve
and certify statements during the certification process. Approving
Officials (AOs) follow pay and confirm procedures and are not
appointed as Certifying Officers, e.g., Air Force AOs under the
Army program.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. GPC Delegation of Authority and appointment
letters will clearly state the duties of the program participant,
any dollar limit of the procurement authority (when applicable),
and any limitations on the scope of authority to be exercised other
than those contained in applicable law or regulation. All
delegates/appointees must countersign their letters electronically
in JAM to acknowledge they understand and concur with their GPC
program responsibilities prior to establishing any accounts in the
bank’s EAS.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. A/OPCs will maintain and monitor all
delegations, appointments letters, and training certificates
electronically in JAM in accordance with section 6-13. If
electronic versions are available, the Level 4 A/OPC is not
required to maintain a hard copy. Audit agencies can request access
to PIEE modules when required. Ensure military and civilian
out-processing checklists include a mandatory A/OPC sign-off for
BOs and CHs.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Receiving a GPC</strong>. Standard
practice is to have the card mailed to the CH’s work address
in accordance with the GSA SmartPay®3 contract. Using a
CH’s home address may be a fraud indicator and should not be
a normal practice. Whether the card is mailed to the CH’s
primary work address or an alternate address, the CH must maintain
the physical security of the card. Examples of alternate address
uses include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) When an A/OPC wants all cards mailed to the
A/OPC’s work address, and then the A/OPC provides each card
to the new CH’s work location.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) When the A/OPC feels it is more reliable to
have the card mailed to the A/OPC’s work address and then
sent by express mail to a CH’s work address overseas.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) When the organization has a policy that all
cards will be sent to the work address of the responsible BO, who
will then deliver each card to the CH in person or to the
CH’s work address.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) When the CH will not be at the work location
(duty station) for an extended period (COVID-19 stay-at-home orders
would be one such example), the CH’s home address could be
used. If</p>
        <p class="p">the CH’s home address is used for card delivery, a note or
memorandum for record must be added to the account notes stating
why the home address was used.</p>

      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. GPCs are issued only as mission requirements
dictate. Only DoD civilian employees or members of the Armed Forces
may be issued a GPC or be appointed a BO. GPCs may not be issued to
contractor personnel, except as provided in paragraph 1-5d. Junior
Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC) instructors, Outside
Continental United States (OCONUS) local national employees of the
Army, and host Government direct-hires for OCONUS
agencies/organizations whose salaries are reimbursed by the Army or
DoD tenant organizations, are not considered DoD contractors, and
may be designated as CHs and BOs. Traditional National Guard
members and State employees are prohibited from being appointed as
a CH, BO or A/OPC. The following types of purchases require a
separate card account dedicated solely for that purpose:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Contract Payments</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Official Representation Funds (ORF)</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Ammunition</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Gift Fund (for donated or proffered monies)</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) Lodging in Kind (LIK) and Subsistence in Kind
(SIK)</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Card Account Limits</strong>. Each card
account has a single purchase limit and a cycle or monthly limit.
In most cases, the single purchase limit is the micro-purchase
threshold. The cycle limit is determined by the anticipated
spending needs of the cardholder.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Managing Account Limits</strong>. Each
managing account has a cycle limit and a credit limit. The cycle
limit is the sum of the monthly limits of all cardholders under the
managing account. The credit limit is three times the managing
account’s cycle limit.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Establishing Credit Limits</strong>.
A/OPCs and RMs must jointly establish appropriate spending limits,
and MCC access tailored to each CH account and MA based on
historical buying patterns/trends, with consideration given to
future mission needs. Budgetary limits may equal but not exceed the
limits established in the CH appointment letter issued in JAM. The
bank’s EAS will maintain single purchase and monthly spending
limits and can restrict purchases to particular MCCs. These limits
may be initially established based on the CH’s delegation
authority and adjusted to meet budgetary constraints. The
procurement authority in the letter of delegation may never exceed
what is authorized by the FAR/DFARS (e.g., a CH with delegated
authority of $10,000 is still limited to $2,500 when purchasing
services subject to Service Contract Labor Standards (41 USC
Chapter 67)). The A/OPC will review individual CH spending limits
each year and coordinate with the BO and RM in the event adjustment
of spending limits as projected for the upcoming year is required.
A/OPCs must update the appointment in JAM before increasing credit
limits in the EAS. The A/OPC and the RM may make changes to the
purchase limits to meet mission requirements within the CH’s
authority.</p>

        <p class="p List1">a. Only cardholders with a continuing need to use
the GPC will retain their card and appointment. At least 60
calendar days prior to reassignment, separation, or retirement, the
CH or BO should notify the A/OPC of their change in status and
begin to transition their duties and files over to another
appointed organization representative. The BO must advise the Level
4 A/OPC when a CH no longer has a continuing need to use the card
or when the CH transfers to other duties or organizations, retires,
or leaves Government service.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. The Level 4 A/OPC will terminate the CH’s
or BO’s appointment in JAM, close the account in the
servicing bank, and remove the User ID. The physical card must be
destroyed. When a CH account is terminated or closed, the CH will
surrender the GPC and submit the account documentation to the
BO.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. When a BO vacates their assignment, and a new
BO is assigned, all CH accounts remain active under the existing

        <p class="p List1">a. Individuals responsible for purchase card
violations (e.g., abuse, delinquency, internal fraud, or misuse)
are subject to administrative and disciplinary action. Pecuniary
liability may apply when there is an erroneous (illegal, improper,
or incorrect) payment. Commanders may take corrective action,
impose disciplinary action (including removal for serious or
repeated infractions), and take other administrative actions for
GPC infractions. If a potential GPC violation is discovered, GPC
personnel will ensure the violation is appropriately
investigated.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. Cardholders and billing officials are
designated as accountable officials per DoD FMR Volume 5, Chapter
5, paragraph 1.1.2. Certifying Officers (i.e., billing officials)
may be held pecuniary liable under USC Title 10, Subtitle A, Part
IV, Chap 165, Sec 2773a for an illegal, improper, or incorrect
payment.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. Cardholders who make unauthorized purchases or
allow others to use the card may be held liable for the total
dollar amount of unauthorized purchases made in connection with the
misuse or negligence. Cardholders may also be held pecuniary liable
for any payment certified based on false or negligent information
they provided to the Certifying Officer.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Command/SCO Oversight</strong>. The
Command/SCO must establish and maintain a command climate to
prevent undue influence over the actions of a cardholder. The
Command/SCO will establish local policies and procedures
identifying informal and formal disciplinary actions to be taken in
the event of noncompliance, fraud, misuse, and abuse. Disciplinary
actions should be based on the severity and frequency of the
infraction and can range from informal actions (such as written or
verbal counseling) to demotion, removal, or potential criminal
prosecution.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Investigation Required</strong>.
Commands must be notified when evidence of fraud or other criminal
activity is identified. Evidence of deliberate abuse will be
referred to the CH’s and/or BO’s command for
appropriate action. The investigation must provide the Army
employee or military member with an opportunity to rebut the
presumed liability.</p>

        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Automatic Suspensions</strong>.
Requests for suspension exemptions for BO accounts with operational
emergencies may be granted on a case-by-case basis. Exemption
requests must be submitted in writing from the Level 4 A/OPC to the
Level 3. In accordance with DoD business practices, U.S. Bank will
automatically suspend BO accounts under the following
conditions:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) BO’s account goes over 60 days past due
(90 days after the billing date). The managing account and all card
accounts under it are suspended until the delinquent payment has
posted.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) BO’s account goes over 180 days past due
(210 days after the billing date). All managing accounts assigned
under the Level 4 agent are suspended until delinquent payment has
posted. The delinquent managing account is permanently closed
(T9).</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) BO’s account has more than 20 open card
and/or checking accounts. The managing account is suspended unless
a waiver has been approved by the Army Level 2 A/OPC.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Before reopening a closed account due to a
delinquent payment, the Level 3 and/or 4 A/OPC will document that
U.S. Bank received full payment. Only the Army Level 2 may reopen
suspended accounts prior to payment being received by U.S. Bank.
Accounts will be closed permanently if more than two suspensions
occur within a 12-month period. Only the Army Level 2 A/OPC may
approve waivers to this policy.</p>

safeguarding their GPC. CHs must take appropriate precautions
comparable to those taken to secure personal checks, credit cards,

prevent compromise. The card should never be surrendered, except
when the account is going to be cancelled. Additionally, the
account number should not be released to anyone other than the
vendor processing the transaction.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Lost or stolen cards</strong>. The CH

        <p class="p List1">c. Only the designated CH has authority to make
purchases with their GPC. The card is not to be used as a company
card (e.g., during a CH’s absence, someone other than the CH
borrows the card to make a purchase). Use of a GPC by multiple
persons is prohibited.</p>
