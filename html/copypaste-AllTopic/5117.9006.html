   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">(a)  <em class="ph i">Appointment.</em>  The appointment of a special “JOC ordering officer” is authorized, but is only required when the contracting officer will not be executing the task orders.  Appointments of ordering officers under each JOC must be minimized.  JOC ordering officers must be nominated by the Director of Public Works (or equivalent facilities engineering manager) and appointed by letter similar to that in 5153.303-2 (see 5101.602-2-92), tailored for JOC, signed by the contracting officer, and approved at a level above the contracting officer, or the chief of the contracting office.</p>
      <p class="p List1">(b)  <em class="ph i">Training</em>.  All JOC ordering officers must receive specific training and orientation from the responsible contracting office.  This training must cover policy and procedures for operation of JOC, including this AFARS coverage, and shall specifically address the ordering officer’s authority, limitations and responsibilities, to include ethics, conflict of interest, and potential pecuniary liabilities.</p>
      <p class="p List1">(c)  <em class="ph i">Authorization and limitations</em>.</p>

      <p class="p List2">(2)  JOC ordering officers may be authorized to sign task orders of greater value, but not to exceed the thresholds as specified in 10 U.S.C. 2805(c)(1), on behalf of the Government, if determined necessary to realize the benefits of JOC, provided that –</p>
      <p class="p List3">(i)  adequate management controls are in place (e.g., contracting officer oversight);</p>
      <p class="p List3">(ii)  adequate training is provided;</p>
      <p class="p List3">(iii)  the contracting officer approves; and </p>
      <p class="p List3">(iv)  the value of any non-pre-priced item(s) does not exceed $2,500.  <em class="ph i">[AFARS Revision #15, dated February 17, 2005]</em>

      <p class="p List3">(i)  the contracting officer specifically delegates this authority in the JOC ordering officer appointment letter (generally will include modifications under the Changes clause, Changed Site Conditions, etc.);</p>
      <p class="p List3">(ii)  the amount of the modification does not exceed the ordering officer’s authority;</p>
      <p class="p List3">(iii)  pricing is accomplished by using the unit price book; and</p>
      <p class="p List3">(iv)  the total value of non-pre-priced items under the order as modified does not exceed the ordering officer’s authority.</p>
      <p class="p List2">(4)  If applicable, numbers for modifications shall be obtained from the contracting officer.  Copies of all modifications shall be immediately provided to the contracting officer for reporting.  Modifications effecting changes to termination actions, or work suspensions, shall be executed by the contracting officer because of legal consideration issues and the potential fiscal issues involved.</p>
