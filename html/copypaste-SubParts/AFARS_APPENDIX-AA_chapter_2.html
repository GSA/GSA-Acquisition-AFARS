          <strong class="ph b">Acquisition Planning. </strong>Acquisition
planning should start when an agency identifies a need for
supplies, construction and/or services. When practical, utilize an
integrated product team (IPT) approach to develop the acquisition
plan and/or strategy as required. This early teaming effort may
reduce false starts and resulting delays that frequently accompany
the preparation of a complex procurement. <em class="ph i">(Reference DoD Source

          <strong class="ph b">Selection of Evaluation Factors<em class="ph i">.</em>
          </strong>
Selecting the correct evaluation factors is the most important
decision in the evaluation process. Structure the evaluation
factors and their relative importance to clearly reflect the needs
of your acquisition, with consideration given to the inclusion and
evaluation of intellectual property/data rights and what is
necessary and prudent be included in the acquisition.</p>
      <p class="p">
          <strong class="ph b">Mandatory Evaluation Considerations<em class="ph i">.</em>
          </strong>
For source selections, you must evaluate cost/price (unless the
exception at FAR 15.304(c)(1)(ii)(A) applies) and the
acceptability/quality of the proposed product or service through
one or more non-cost evaluation factors (e.g., past performance,
technical excellence, management capability, and key personnel
qualifications).</p>
      <p class="p">As stated at FAR 15.304(c)(1)(ii)(A)), the PCO may exclude
cost/price as an evaluation factor for a Multiple Award IDIQ effort
issued for the same or similar services if the Government intends
to make award to all "qualifying offerors" and Cost/Price will be
considered as one of the factors for all tasks/delivery orders.</p>
      <p class="p" id="AFARS_APPENDIX-AA_2_2__Hlt514027624">Additionally, you must evaluate past performance on all
negotiated competitive acquisitions expected to exceed the
thresholds identified in FAR 15.304 and
DFARS 215.304, unless the PCO documents why it would not be
appropriate. There may be other required evaluation factors, such
as small business participation, based upon regulatory and/or
statutory requirements. <em class="ph i">(See FAR 1</em>
          <span class="ph" id="AFARS_APPENDIX-AA_2_2__Hlt498146333"></span>
          <em class="ph i">5.304 and its supplements)</em>
        </p>
      <p class="p">From this vantage point, the acquisition team must apply prudent
business judgment to add other evaluation factors, subfactors, and
elements that are important to selecting the most advantageous
proposal(s). The number of factors and subfactors should be kept to
the absolute minimum required to effectively assess the
proposal(s). The use of more factors than needed to conduct the
evaluation can complicate and extend the process, while providing
no additional value and thereby diluting meaningful discriminators.
Limiting factors also serves to reduce the evaluation oversight
span-of-control responsibilities of the SSEB leadership, SSA/SSAC,
PCO, and legal counsel, thereby permitting more focused oversight
on the remaining (and most important) factors/subfactors and
reducing the likelihood of evaluation errors.</p>
      <p class="p">Common evaluation factors are cost/price, technical, past
performance, and small business participation.</p>
      <p class="p">
          <strong class="ph b">NOTE</strong>: Ensure small business participation
remains an independent factor, not subordinate and a subfactor to
any other evaluation factor. Additionally, if appropriate for the
requirement, you may have other evaluation factors and/or may use
one or more levels of subfactors. The standard Army naming
convention for the various levels is: Evaluation Factor, Subfactor,
and Element. <em class="ph i">(See Figure 2-1)</em>

          </strong> The acquisition team develops the
evaluation factors and any appropriate subfactors and elements. The
team should select the factors based on user requirements,
acquisition objectives, thorough market research and risk analysis.
Figure 2-2 illustrates the steps involved in developing the factors
and subfactors. The use of elements should only be utilized on rare
occasions. <em class="ph i">(AFARS 5115.304)</em>
        </p>
      <p class="p">Once the RFP is issued, the factors and subfactors give the
offerors insight into the significant considerations the government
will use in selecting the best value proposal and help them to
understand the source selection process. Carefully consider whether
minimum “acceptable/unacceptable” entry-gates can be
included.</p>
      <p class="p">The team must also specify whether technical ratings will be
applied at the subfactor level or rolled up to the factor level,
with the information contained and clearly stated in the RFP so all
stakeholders know how the evaluation of ratings will be
applied.</p>
      <p class="p">
          <strong class="ph b">NOTE</strong>: The Small Business Subcontracting Plan is
not a factor or subfactor to be rated but, as stated at FAR
19.705-4, shall be reviewed for adequacy and determined to be
“acceptable or unacceptable based the requirements identified

can streamline the evaluation process significantly.”

          </strong> Allowance and
guidelines for use of contracted advisory services is stated at FAR

the agency. Nongovernment advisors may assist in and provide input
regarding the evaluation, but they shall not determine ratings or

allowances and or access that will be given the advisors (e.g.,
access to the entire proposal or only access to the part concerning
their particular expertise? Can they write strengths and weaknesses
or only assist other evaluators in this process? Can they
participate in the consensus process without participating
in/providing input for the rating assignment?).</p>

          </strong> When using nongovernment
advisors, you must advise potential offerors of the nongovernment

the offerors consent to provide access to its proprietary
information to the nongovernment advisor or the company which
employs the nongovernment advisor. Figure 2-3 identifies suggested
RFP language relative to the use of commercial firms to support the
source selection process. <em class="ph i">(Reference DoD Source Selection

          <strong class="ph b">Source Selection for Services<em class="ph i">.</em>
          </strong> The
source selection process for services, including development of the
SSP, is often very complex. Organizations must ensure that the SST
is comprised of qualified personnel with specific knowledge of the
types of services to be acquired.</p>
      <p class="p">The use of Sample Tasks is an effective tool in the evaluation
of services. Sample Tasks can provide insight as to the
offeror’s level of understanding of the work to be performed,
as well as how the technical approach relates to the cost/price
proposed for that Sample Task. (<em class="ph i">See Appendix H for an example
of a Sample Task</em>.)</p>
      <p class="p"> To the maximum extent practicable, sample tasks should
set forth requirements that are contemplated for award,
establishing the expectation that offerors will be held accountable
for the resources and costs they propose.</p>
      <p class="p"> The use of generic or hypothetical sample tasks may
unintentionally create an environment that misleads offerors to
understate resources and costs due to the fact that the sample
tasks will not be awarded. Care must be taken to draft the sample
tasks as closely as possible to the types and scope of services
expected to be acquired from the Performance Work Statement (PWS).
If possible, consider the use of a “live” task, which
would be awarded at time of contract award<em class="ph i">.</em>
        </p>
      <p class="p"> Evaluation criteria should be limited to essential
areas of performance that are measurable during the proposal
evaluation process. This will permit a more focused evaluation of
the offeror’s proposed solution to the sample task.</p>
      <p class="p"> If utilizing a sample task, ensure this is accounted
for and aligned with Sections L and M (or equivalent sections for
procurements not using uniform contract format (UCF)).</p>

Documents.</em>
          </strong> RFP inconsistencies can create ambiguity
and result in less advantageous offers, require RFP amendments,
cause delays in the acquisition, and result in litigation.
Inconsistencies between the descriptions of the government’s
requirements, instructions on how to prepare a proposal, and
information related to the evaluation factors and subfactors are
particularly troublesome and can be a result of various groups of
personnel developing different RFP sections without adequate
coordination and review. Additionally, when one document is
revised, those revisions must also be made to other corresponding
documents.</p>
      <p class="p">It may be beneficial to develop a matrix that correlates the RFP
sections and content to ensure consistency. Figure 2-4 illustrates
how key documents and evaluation standards map to one another,
showing the recommended sequencing for document preparation.
Providing industry with a similar copy of the matrix as a reference
tool and part of the solicitation can aid in proposal preparation.
You may also consider including a column for offerors to complete
in the tracking matrix (as shown in Figure 2-4), denoting where in
their proposal the requirement is addressed. This approach promotes
understanding of the linkage within the solicitation, explains how
all parts of the proposal will be used in the evaluation process,
and enables a crosswalk for both the government and offerors to
ensure all requirements have been addressed.</p>

Offerors<em class="ph i">.</em>
          </strong> Instructions for preparing and
submitting proposals are critical to the acquisition. Always keep
in mind:</p>
      <p class="p"> There must be a direct linkage between solicitation
requirements and objectives, each evaluation factor and subfactor,
and the proposal preparation instructions.</p>
      <p class="p"> Request only the <strong class="ph b">essential information</strong>
needed to evaluate proposals against the evaluation factors and
subfactors.</p>
      <p class="p"> Never ask for information that will not be evaluated.
Instructions that require voluminous information can
unintentionally limit or reduce competition by causing potential
offerors to forego responding to the solicitation in favor of a
less costly business opportunity.</p>
      <p class="p"> Excessively large proposals may increase the time and
costs associated with performing the evaluation. Specific guidance
such as proposal page limitations or page recommendations and
narrative font style and size are encouraged but need to be clearly
defined and tailored to the needs of the acquisition.</p>
      <p class="p"> Focus exclusively on <strong class="ph b">true
discriminators</strong> (discriminators linked to critical
requirements which are based on market research, the assessment of
risk, and that enables the evaluation to discern between various
values in the offeror’s proposal). Failure to do so dilutes
the evaluation and compromises the SSA’s ability to identify
the best value proposal.</p>
      <p class="p"> Use performance-based requirements but remain mindful
that design requirements that are too detailed, or overly
prescriptive performance work statements, severely limits the
offerors’ flexibility to propose their best solutions.
Instead, use functional or performance-based requirements to the
maximum extent practicable. While it may be more difficult to
develop evaluation criteria and conduct the evaluation process
using this approach, the benefits warrant and support it. These
benefits can include increased competition, access to the best
commercial technology, better technical solutions, and fewer
situations for protests.</p>

      <p class="p">
          <strong class="ph b">NOTE<em class="ph i">:</em>
          </strong> Clearly advise offerors to keep

            <u class="ph u">Past Performance Information</u>
            <em class="ph i">.</em>
          </strong>
Tailor the proposal submission requirements to reflect the
complexity of the procurement and the relative importance assigned
to past performance. Request only the information necessary for the
evaluation. Consider the following when developing proposal
submission requirements:</p>
      <p class="p"> <strong class="ph b">Contract references<em class="ph i">.</em>
          </strong> Request
offerors to submit a list of government and non-government contract
references to include joint venture participation. References are
to include contract number, contract type and dollar value, place
of performance, date of award, whether performance is on-going or
complete, extent of subcontracting, and the names, phone numbers,
and e-mail addresses of at least two points of contacts for each
contract.</p>
      <p class="p">o Require the list to include all relevant on-going contracts,
or contracts completed during a specified period. This approach
will provide an ‘unfiltered’ view of the
offeror’s contract efforts, not just the ‘select’
contract efforts. If you anticipate the number of contracts will be
excessive, limit the submission to a specified number of the most
recent, relevant contracts. In such cases, require the contracts to
have been active for a specified period of time, since newly
awarded contracts will probably not provide sufficient
information.</p>
      <p class="p">o Recommend limiting the specified period to contracts performed
within the last three years, or no greater than six years for
simple construction, architect-engineering (A-E) contracts, and
more complex works. Recency of past performance should be
calculated using the RFP release date as a benchmark. A shorter
period may be appropriate for acquisitions where there are numerous
actions and/or many vendors providing the required items.</p>
      <p class="p">o When appropriate and determining recency for certain types of
large construction works (e.g., military housing, navigation
projects or other large civil works), a greater time period in
excess of six years should be considered and used to obtain
realistic examples of past performance.</p>
      <p class="p">o When offerors are likely to be large, multi-function firms,
limit the contract references to those performed by the segment of
the firm (e.g., division, group, and unit) that is submitting a
proposal.</p>
      <p class="p"> <strong class="ph b">Past Performance Information of a Prospective
Subcontractor<em class="ph i">.</em>
          </strong> When planning how a
subcontractors’ past performance is intended to be evaluated,
explain how any related adverse past performance information will
be handled. In some acquisitions, an offeror’s prospective
subcontractor may be the offeror’s competitor on other
acquisitions. In such cases, the prospective subcontractor may be
hesitant to have any adverse information related to its past
performance released to the offeror. The acquisition should be
tailored accordingly and advise offerors in the RFP how the
disclosure of such information will be handled.</p>
      <p class="p">
<strong class="ph b">Questionnaires.</strong>Questionnaires
or interviews may be utilized to obtain the information from
individuals having knowledge about the offeror’s past
performance, and details such as contract points of contact (name,
email, and phone numbers) shall be included in the information
provided back to the government in the proposal.</p>
      <p class="p">Consider the following when using questionnaires:</p>
      <p class="p">o Keep the questionnaire short. Typically, it should be no
longer than 1-2 pages.</p>
      <p class="p">o Format the questionnaire to easily facilitate electronic
completion (e.g., fill-in blocks, and electronic checkboxes).</p>
      <p class="p">o Include a copy of the questionnaire in the RFP.</p>
      <p class="p">o Either distribute the questionnaires to the points of contact
or have the offerors distribute the questionnaires. Prior to the
government sending out the questionnaires, and when practical,
contact the respective points of contact and emphasize the
importance of the completed questionnaires returned to the
government promptly. Having the offerors send out the
questionnaires may save time and resources.</p>
      <p class="p"> <strong class="ph b">Small Business Participation Past
Performance</strong>. All offerors shall submit information
substantiating their past performance and compliance with FAR
52.219-8 Utilization of Small Business Concerns, FAR 52.219-9 Small
Business Subcontracting Plan, and DFARS Subpart 215.305 Proposal
Evaluation, to maximize opportunities for small business
subcontractors. Offerors shall also provide a statement indicating
whether any negative information has been reported in the past
three years (or other number of years as identified in the
solicitation) concerning their past compliance with FAR 52.219-8 or
FAR 52.219-9. If any such negative information is reported, the
offeror may submit explanations or comments responding to such
negative information. Offerors with no prior contracts containing
FAR 52.219-8 and/or 52.219-9 shall certify stating as such. For
other than small business, include SF 294 and SF 295 (or Individual
Subcontracting and Summary Subcontracting Reports in eSRS)
information for Government contracts with these reporting
requirements for the last <em class="ph i">X</em> (fill in number, same as
period stated elsewhere for past performance) number of years.</p>
      <p class="p"> <strong class="ph b">Relevant Past Performance<em class="ph i">.</em>
          </strong>
Include in the RFP a definition of what constitutes relevant past
performance. Factors that may be used to define relevancy include
similarity, size, complexity, dollar value, contract type, and
degree of subcontracting/teaming. As appropriate, require the
offeror provide a description of how the contract references are
relevant to the immediate acquisition. In some cases, previous
contracts as a whole may be relevant to the immediate acquisition,
while only portions of other contracts may be relevant.</p>

          </strong>
The Army methodology for evaluating small business participation in
<strong class="ph b">unrestricted</strong> source selections is to establish a
separate factor (versus a subfactor under technical) with an
assigned relative order of importance for small business
participation as it relates to the other source selection
evaluation factors as stated at FAR 15.304(c)(3)(ii) and
(c)(4).</p>
      <p class="p">When evaluating small business participation, solicitations must
be structured to give offers submitted by small business concerns
the highest rating for this evaluation factor in accordance with
FAR 15.305(a)(5). In addition, small businesses are not required to
submit any information (see C.F.R.125.3(g)(3)) in connection with
the small business participation evaluation factor or required to
submit a proposed Small Business Participation Commitment
Document.</p>
      <p class="p">
          <strong class="ph b"> Proposal Submission Instructions</strong>. The
submission instructions should be written clearly enough to
indicate that:</p>
      <p class="p">o Other than small business contractors may achieve the small
business participation goals through subcontracting to small
businesses.</p>
      <p class="p">o Small business contractors may achieve small business

a prime and also through a joint venture, teaming arrangement,
and/or subcontracting to other small businesses.</p>
      <p class="p"> <strong class="ph b">Small Business Participation Commitment
Document (SBPCD).</strong> The SBPCD format is designed to
streamline and bring uniformity to responses and evaluations for
small business participation when required under FAR 15.304. The

Other than small businesses will be evaluated on their level of
proposed small business participation in the performance of a
resulting contract relative to the objectives established herein.
Offerors shall submit a SBPCD which specifies the offeror’s
level and degree of commitment to small business
utilization/participation in performance of this requirement. A
SBPCD is required from all offerors, including companies with
commercial plans and comprehensive subcontracting plans.</p>
      <p class="p">Small businesses are not required to submit subcontracting plans
but will be required to address the extent of small business
performance (participation) in their proposals when required by the
solicitation.</p>
      <p class="p">The government may evaluate:</p>
      <p class="p"> The extent to which such firms, as defined in FAR Part
19, are specifically identified in proposals;</p>
      <p class="p"> The extent of commitment to use such firms (and

Plan.</p>
      <p class="p"> Small business participation goals/Minimum Quantitative
Requirement (MRQ) is based on market research (e.g., inclusive of
researching historical data and contacting subject matter experts).
Research can entail the type and complexity of work, the
availability of small businesses, and their capability and
capacity.</p>
      <p class="p"> If using the percentage of subcontracted dollars for
the SBPCD, the dollars should correlate directly to the percentage
of subcontracted dollars in the small business subcontracting plan
for other than small businesses. <strong class="ph b">NOTE:</strong> DoD’s
assigned subcontracting goals may be used to establish small
business participation minimum goals when market research results
confirms that these goals are achievable or when market research is
lacking sufficient data to use another source as a baseline.</p>
      <p class="p"> Small business prime offerors shall be advised that
their own participation as a prime can be counted towards the
percentages set in this evaluation factor. Small businesses shall
not be required to subcontract to other small businesses in order
to achieve the small business participation goals, unless small
business goals are set as a percentage of planned subcontracting
dollars.</p>
      <p class="p"> Requiring offerors to provide both the percentage and
the associated total dollar equivalent of work to be performed by
small businesses can assist in providing consistency in the
evaluation. Additionally, the information may be helpful to provide
transparency for small businesses when previously performed
services are currently consolidated and/or bundled into an
