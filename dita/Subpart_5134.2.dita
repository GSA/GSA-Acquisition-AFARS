The class deviation applies to FPIF contracts for full rate production (FRP) subsequent to the first FRP lot, in support of Defense acquisition programs, supporting services contracts where work is not measurable and discrete, and contracts for non-developmental services not supporting a Defense acquisition program. This deviation is effective until incorporated in the DFARS or rescinded.</p>
