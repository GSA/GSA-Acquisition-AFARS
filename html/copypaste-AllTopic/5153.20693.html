      <p class="p">
         a. DPC Class Deviation 2023-O0003 REV 2—Temporary Authorizations for Covered Contracts Related to Ukraine implements subsection 1244(a) of the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (NDAA FY2023). The Joint Explanatory Statement that accompanies NDAA FY2023 requires the Department to notify in writing the congressional defense committees when using an authority provided in that subsection. </p>
      <p class="p">
         b. The Public Interest exception for use of other than competitive procedures at Section 1244(a)(2) and DPC Class Deviation 2023-O0003 REV 2 (B) requires Congressional notification no later than 7-days before awarding a covered contract. Contracting officers shall use the sample format at AFARS 5153.303-12 for the notification. </p>
      <p class="p">
         c. 
         Other temporary authorities in subsection 1244(a)(3) through (5) and DPC Class Deviation 2023-O0003 REV 2 (C) through (E) (i.e. Special Emergency Procurement Authority; Undefinitized Contract Actions; or Temporary Exemption from Certified Cost and Pricing Data Requirements) require Congressional notification within 30 days of using the authority. Contracting Officers shall submit congressional defense notification for HQDA review, coordination, and/or approval via ETMS2 to the ODASA(P) directorate listed at AFARS 5101.290(b)(1)(ii)(B) within 30 days of using this authority in order to meet the congressional defense committee requirement. 
      </p>
      <p class="p">
         d. Furthermore, to forecast workload requirements, the ODASA(P) will task Commands via the Enterprise Task Management Software Solution (ETMS2) monthly to provide a listing of applicable actions falling within the 30-day congressional notification period. A template will be provided in ETMS2 requiring specific authority used, a description of such use, reason for such use, and expected outcome of such use. Contracting Officers shall submit this data via ETMS2 as instructed. </p>
