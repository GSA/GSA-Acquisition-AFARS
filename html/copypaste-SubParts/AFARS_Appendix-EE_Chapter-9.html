      <p class="p">1) Purchases outside the Continental United States (OCONUS). In addition, for units in Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom, the preferred use policy for office supplies is through the Joint Office Supply Europe program (JOSE).

      <p class="p">3) Purchases for an unplanned urgent need required on the same day. Poor acquisition planning and inadequate market research do not apply to this exception. Use of this exception requires valid documentation and retention in the purchase card file.</p>
      <p class="p">4) Purchases through FedMall. When the FedMall website is unavailable for more than 24 hours, cardholders may place orders directly with the Office Supply BPA vendor through another form of communication.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. <a class="xref" href="https://chess.army.mil/" target="_blank">CHESS</a> is the mandatory source for all purchases of
commercial-off-the-shelf software, desktops, notebook computers, video
teleconferencing equipment, and other commercial Information Technology (IT)
equipment (e.g., routers, servers, printers, peripherals, regardless of dollar
value). CHESS is the mandatory source for all Army IT purchases, except for the
Air National Guard, which is exempt from the CHESS requirement and must purchase
IT through <a class="xref" href="https://www.afadvantage.gov/" target="_blank">AFADVANTAGE/GSA-2GIT</a> to retain IT compatibility. Per
AFARS 5108.7403, before procuring commercial software outside of the CHESS
contracts, the contracting officer or contract ordering official CH must ensure
that the requiring activity obtains a waiver. Any IT hardware or software
purchase made outside of CHESS requires a Statement of Non-availability (SoNA).
See AFARS 5139.101-90(a) and AR 25-1.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. All desktops and notebooks must be purchased during one of the
Consolidated Buy ordering periods that occur three times annually (Oct/Jan,
Feb/May, and Jun/Sep). Consolidated Buy exception memos are prepared by the
requiring activity and are approved by an O6/GS-15 (or equivalent) within the
requiring activity and must remain a part of the transaction document file. An
exception memo example is available at <a class="xref" href="https://chess.army.mil/Content/Page/CB_EXPT" target="_blank">CHESS Exception Request</a>.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. IT hardware or software purchases require an Army Deputy Chief of Staff
(DCS), G-6 approved Information Technology Approval System (ITAS) Memorandum.
CHs must include the ITAS Approval Memorandum in the transaction file along with
all other supporting documentation. Supporting documentation must include
documentation submitted with the ITAS approval request such as a CHESS SoNA. The
CHESS website provides information concerning ITAS approvals. CHs may also
consult their local command for guidance. The ITAS Approval website is located
at <a class="xref" href="https://cprobe.army.mil/enterprise-portal/web/itas/home" target="_blank">https://cprobe.army.mil/enterprise-portal/web/itas/home</a>.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. Any IT hardware or software purchase made outside of CHESS requires a
SoNA. A SoNA is a notice that a particular product is not currently available
through a CHESS contract. It is not a waiver to purchase, nor does it authorize
use on the Army network. For detailed instructions on SoNA requirements and how
to obtain a SoNA, see <a class="xref" href="https://chess.army.mil/Content/Page/SONA" target="_blank">CHESS SONA</a>.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">9-7.</span> Supplemental Procurement Guidance</h2>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">Sustainable Procurement</strong>. Sustainable procurement is the purchase of
environmentally preferable products and services in accordance with
federally-mandated "green" procurement preference programs. The goal is to
achieve 100% compliance with mandatory Federal affirmative procurement programs
in all acquisition transactions. This policy applies to all acquisitions from
major systems programs to individual unit supply and service requisitions. For
more information on sustainable procurement, see FAR 23 or specific sustainable
policies located at <a class="xref" href="https://www.denix.osd.mil/spp/guidance/index.html" target="_blank">https://www.denix.osd.mil/spp/guidance/index.html</a>.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">FedMall</strong>. FedMall is a Government e-commerce acquisition platform
which may be used for procuring supplies beyond those listed in Section 8-1. CHs
who use FedMall are required to register for a FedMall account. To register, CHs
will need to know their Department of Defense Activity Address Code (DoDAAC) or
their Activity Address Code (AAC). If FedMall does not recognize the CH’s DoDAAC
or AAC, CHs should contact their A/OPC to request the contracting office’s
Procurement DoDAAC for registration. <a class="xref" href="https://www.dla.mil/Working-With-DLA/Applications/FedMall/" target="_blank">FedMall</a> is accessible through the CH’s PIEE account via
the FedMall icon.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">General Services Administration (GSA) Programs</strong>. GSA maintains the
Federal Supply Schedule program, also known as the GSA Schedules Program or the
Multiple Award Schedule Program. GSA offers an online shopping service called <a class="xref" href="https://www.gsaadvantage.gov/" target="_blank">GSA Advantage!</a> through which CHs may place orders
against Schedules. CHs may also use GSA Advantage! to place orders through <a class="xref" href="https://www.gsaglobalsupply.gsa.gov/" target="_blank">GSA’s Global Supply System</a>, a GSA wholesale supply
source, formerly known as "GSA Stock" or the "Customer Supply Center."</p>
      <p class="p">1) GSA Advantage! enables CHs to search specific information (e.g., national
stock number, part number, common name), review delivery options, place orders
directly with Schedule contractors, and pay for orders using the GPC.</p>
      <p class="p">2) CHs may place orders up to the MPT with any FSS contractor that can meet
the agency’s needs. Although not required to solicit from a specific number of
schedule contractors, ordering activities should attempt to distribute orders
among contractors.</p>
      <p class="p">3) Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI) agreements are accessible at <a class="xref" href="http://www.gsa.gov/fssi" target="_blank">FSSI</a>. Cardholders should consider FSSI before using
commercial sources.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. Specific guidance on the use of required sources and order of precedence
of sources is prescribed in FAR Part 8 and DFARS Part 208. In addition to
mandatory sources, CHs should strongly consider purchasing from small businesses
and small disadvantaged businesses whenever possible.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Commercial Sources</strong>. Before purchasing from a commercial source, CHs
must review applicable mandatory sources (see Table 9-1) and non-mandatory
Government sources (e.g., FedMall and GSA). CHs should rotate commercial
sources. CHs may purchase from a commercial source if the requested supplies or
services are unavailable from the applicable mandatory source. Price is an
unacceptable reason to avoid a mandatory source. CHs may choose a commercial
source over a non-mandatory Government source, if the commercial quote is more
favorable due to minimum order quantity, delivery time, price, etc. When buying
from a commercial source, CHs should include a justification in the purchase
request form or file documentation explaining why they chose a non-Government
source.</p>

   <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title9">
      <span class="ph autonumber">9-8.</span> E-Commerce Platforms</h2>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. An e-marketplace platform is an online platform where CHs can evaluate and
order products via a portal operated by a vendor: the portal provider. The
e-marketplace platforms can offer portal provider products and/or third-party
vendor products. Portal providers and third-party vendors are generally
responsible for fulfilling orders for their respective products.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. GSA’s Commercial Platforms program (also known as GSA’s e-commerce
platforms) provides a managed channel for open-market purchases through select
commercial online platforms (this currently includes AmazonBusiness.com,
FisherSci.com, and OverstockGovernment.com). As this program is a relatively new
initiative, DPC approval is required in advance of Component participation.
Components making or seeking to make purchases using all other non-DoD
e-commerce platforms are required to notify the Agency Program Management Office
in writing and provide implementation information as requested.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. Third-party payment processor policy does not apply to e-commerce
platforms or brick-and-mortar merchants that do not accept payment using
third-party payment processors. In the e-commerce space, this includes, at a
minimum, those in GSA’s Commercial Platforms program, and AmazonBusiness.com
(separate and distinct from AmazonBusiness.com participating in GSA’s Commercial
Platforms program). However, as such platforms could change their payment
practices and begin allowing use of third-party payment processors, CPMs are
responsible for issuing Component-level policy that:</p>
      <p class="p">1) Establishes and implements procedures for validating that each applicable
e-commerce platform continues to disallow use of third-party payment processors.
Procedures shall include a certain periodicity for re-validating following
initial validation, for each applicable e-commerce platform. This re-validation
shall occur at least semi-annually.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Ensures that following completion of each validation and re-validation,
GPC oversight personnel and CHs are notified regarding whether or not the
applicable e-commerce platform does not/continues not to accept payment using
third party payment processors to meet this criterion for non-applicability of
third-party payment policy.</p>
      <p class="p">3) Mandates that upon notification that an e-commerce platform has begun
accepting payment using third party payment processors, CHs begin complying with
DoD and Component third-party payment policy, for the applicable platform.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">E-Marketplace Platform Method of Payment</strong>. The GPC is the only
authorized method of payment for purchases placed on the e-marketplace
platforms. CHs are not allowed to use any other forms of payment, including
third-party payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Venmo, Google Wallet, WePay, etc)
or payments using any form of cryptocurrency. The GPC will be the only allowable
method of payment, and all GPCs must be used by an authorized CH. The
e-marketplace model encourages robust competition not only at the platform level
by offering millions of products across thousands of suppliers, but also at the
product level, with multiple suppliers competing to sell a given product.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Compliance with AbilityOne</strong>. Mandatory sources such as AbilityOne
are effectively represented and promoted in this program. Rather than simply
state that e-marketplaces are required to “block and sub” the commercial item
for the AbilityOne item, GSA requires platform providers to prevent the sale of
a commercial item which is “essentially the same” as an item on the AbilityOne
Procurement List. In addition, GSA requires platform providers to ensure the
vendors selling AbilityOne products are, in fact, authorized distributors.</p>
      <p class="p List1">f. <strong class="ph b">Data Visibility</strong>. Identifying leakage through the commercial
platforms will allow the Army the ability to identify purchases that could be
going to AbilityOne distributors, small business suppliers, excluded entities,
or spend outside of strategic or mandatory-use agency contracts. This data then
allows the Army to take the necessary action in an effort to appropriately
manage this spend. Spend data will be available to the Army through on-demand
reports and dashboards, allowing the Army to see line-level spend from all
e-marketplace platforms. CHs will also have real-time, account level access to
their purchasing data through the e-marketplace platforms for purchase card
reconciliation and spend analysis.</p>
      <p class="p List1">g. <strong class="ph b">Supply Chain Security</strong>. To address vulnerabilities within the global
supply chain, GSA is implementing several solutions to create additional
visibility and reduce concerns related to supply chain security. The approach is
two-fold and addresses removal of both prohibited vendors and prohibited
products. GSA’s approach includes the following:</p>
      <p class="p">1) Section 1634, which limits or prohibits the purchase of certain items,
based on statutory requirements that apply to all Federal purchases, including
purchases from Kaspersky Lab.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Curating or filtering what Federal buyers can purchase, by allowing
agencies to prohibit categories of items from purchase, where necessary.</p>
      <p class="p">3) Recommending best practices for e-commerce platforms and third-party
marketplaces, as described in the DHS report, Combating Trafficking in
Counterfeit and Pirated Goods, from January 24, 2020.</p>
      <p class="p">4) Leveraging the commercial Supply Chain Risk Management practices that
e-marketplace platforms already possess around counterfeit and supply chain
concerns, to include data associated with country of origin and detailed product
descriptions, as well as quality control practices and supplier performance.</p>
      <p class="p">5) Reviewing spend data post-purchase to identify any suspect purchases that
might have slipped through the cracks and warrant further review.</p>
      <p class="p">6) Section 889 on the prohibition on procurement of certain telecommunication
and video surveillance equipment applies to the commercial e-commerce program as
it does to every other Federal contract.</p>
      <p class="p">7) CHs may consider a product’s Country of Origin when made available on the
e-marketplace platforms as a part of their buying criteria.</p>
