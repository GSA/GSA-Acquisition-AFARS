A CRB is not required for modifications that exercise an option, add incremental funding, or make administrative changes.  The SRB and CRB will be independent, multi-functional teams comprised of senior level experts, which will, at a minimum, include representatives from the contracting activity, small business office, office of counsel, requirements community, and in the case of noncompetitive actions, the advocate for competition.
