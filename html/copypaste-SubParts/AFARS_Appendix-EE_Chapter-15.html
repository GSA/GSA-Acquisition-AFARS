      <span class="ph autonumber">15-1.</span> Contract Payments</h2>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. Given the continuing evolution of electronic payment capabilities, the
Army must periodically perform reviews of existing payment practices to optimize
effectiveness. These reviews should consider factors such as ease of use,
opportunities to generate revenue from payment processes ("refunds"), price
discounts for faster vendor payment, transaction fees, transaction data, and
internal controls.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_15-1__Hlk112839449">b. The GPC may be used as a payment method on contracts. See
FAR 32.1108. The Contracting Officer will make the determination and choose to
use the GPC as the payment method for CHs to make contract payments on formal
contract vehicles up to the limit of the Contracting Officer’s warrant when the
GPC payment method is proven to be more advantageous to the Government.
Contracting officers are required to ensure contractor invoices are accurate.
Benefits to increasing GPC contract payments include greatly increased refunds
per effort expended, exemption from GPC data mining, and faster receipt of
payments. On average, vendors are paid within 3 to 4 days with a GPC. Additional
benefits may include decreased paperwork and costs, improved reconciliation,
reduced labor-intensive processes, and reduced fraud and charge-back risk.
Warranted contracting officers do not require a separate authority letter to use
the GPC. Contracting Officers normally appoint CHs residing in the contracting
office as GPC contract payment CHs. The Contracting Officer or an A/OPC with the
appropriate delegating authority may appoint GPC contract payment CHs outside
the contracting office providing the Contracting Officer or A/OPC with the
appropriate delegating authority provides adequate training and oversight.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. The contract must be properly entered in the financial management system
with the correct LOA, and the LOA must be entered into the servicing bank’s EAS
to ensure the financial management system posts the payment against the
appropriate contract line item number. All modifications impacting payment
and/or funding (including options exercised) must be re-coordinated with the RM,
CH, and BO to ensure the financial management system and the bank’s EAS are
properly updated. Failure to do so will result in the servicing bank not being
paid which may result in a possible account delinquency. The CH will maintain
supporting documentation in the bank’s EAS for each contract payment made using
the GPC.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. At a minimum, procedures will be in place to ensure proper separation of
duties to safeguard Government resources and to avoid the posting of double
obligations associated with the use of the GPC to make payment on existing
contract vehicles. Contracts where the GPC is used as the method of payment are
required to be fully funded. No progress (finance) payments are authorized.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">FPDS-NG</strong>. Contracting Officers are responsible for ensuring the FPDS
reporting is completed.</p>
      <p class="p List1">f. FAR policy requires the consent of contractors when contemplating the use
of GPC as the payment method. Consent is typically obtained by including FAR
clause 52.232-36 in the solicitation and, if the contractor does not object, the
contract. Existing contracts may be modified to include the clause, with the
consent of the contractor. The vendor, not the Army, pays the bank an
interchange fee of approximately 3% of the transaction amount.</p>
      <p class="p List1">g. <strong class="ph b">Contract Payment Processes</strong>. The servicing bank has two different
methods for contract payments: a payment card process and a Payment Plus
process. See 15-4 and Figure 15-1 for a description of the payment card process.
See 15-5 and Figure 15-2 for a description of the Payment Plus process.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">15-2.</span> Contract Clauses.</h2>
  <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p">FAR 32.1108 and 32.1110(d) provide instructions for use of the
      appropriate clause when payment under a written contract is made by GPC.
      When using the GPC for contract payments, the contracting officer will
      insert the FAR clause 52.232-36, Payment by Third Party, in solicitations
      and contracts. Payment by a purchase card may also be made under a
      contract that does not contain the clause at 52.232-36, to the extent the
      contractor agrees to accept that method of payment. When the clause at
      52.232-36 is included in a solicitation or contract, the contracting
      officer will also insert the clause at 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic
      Funds Transfer—Central Contractor Registration, or 52.232-34, Payment by
      Electronic Funds Transfer—Other Than Central Contractor Registration, as
      appropriate. The contracting officer should also insert DFARS clause
      252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving
      Reports. </p>

        <p class="p">1) Some purchase orders (POs) are created automatically via interface upon contract award as is the case with SPS, LMP, and DMLSS. To prevent double obligations, the A/OPC must work with the servicing bank for the proper EDI file set up.</p>

    <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">The Army must follow all the necessary internal contracting procedures before starting the Payment Card Process. The CH has a GPC that is embossed and established for only “Contract Payments.” The RM builds the managing account with Account Validation Control (AVC) “EDI CP GFEBS.” Cardholder creates a manual purchase order for each contract. Cardholder provides the same card information to the contractor as they would for a purchase to the merchant. The person within the agency responsible for the payments is the BO who will certify the invoice “transaction(s)” for payment to the bank.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. Wide Area Workflow (WAWF) is a secure, web-based system for electronic
invoicing, receipt and acceptance. WAWF allows Government vendors to submit and
track invoices and receipt/acceptance documents over the Web and allows
Government personnel to process those invoices in a real-time, paperless
environment. WAWF is in accordance with the 2001 National Defense Authorization
Act (DFARS 252.232-7003/252.232.7003 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests -
January 2004), which requires claims for payment under a DoD contract to be
submitted in electronic form.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. DFARS Appendix F contains procedures and instructions for the use,
preparation, and distribution of the WAWF Receiving Report (RR) and commercial
shipping/packing lists used to document Government contract quality assurance.
Preparation instructions and training for the WAWF RR are available at <a class="xref" href="https://piee.eb.mil/" target="_blank">PIEE</a>. The instructions on preparing a WAWF RR are part
of the Vendor Training section.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. On March 3, 2008, DoD issued a final rule amending the DFARS to require
use of WAWF as the only acceptable electronic system for submitting requests for
payment (invoices and receiving reports) under DoD contracts.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. WAWF helps to mitigate interest penalty payments due to lost or misplaced
documents and highlights vendor-offered discounts so that the DoD benefits on
both fronts, in addition to streamlining the whole process from weeks to days or
minutes. Benefits include online access and full spectrum view of document
status, minimized re-keying and improving data accuracy, eliminating unmatched
disbursements, and making all documentation required for payment easily
accessible.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">15-7.</span> Purchase Card Receiving Report (PCRR) Process</h2>
  <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. Wide Area Workflow must be utilized when making contract payments with
      the GPC per DFARS 232.7002, 232.7003, and 252.232-7003. The contractor
      must use WAWF to create the purchase card receiving report (PCRR) when the
      GPC is used as a method of payment. The CH provides the following
      information to the contractor to submit PCRR into WAWF:</p>
      <p class="p"> </p>
      <p class="p">1) Vendor Identifier: Vendor/Company Name</p>
      <p class="p">2) Payment Office: CRCARD </p>
      <p class="p">3) Ship to:</p>
      <p class="p">4) Inspect by: </p>
      <p class="p">5) Accept by: </p>
      <p class="p">6) Card Issuing Bank ID: 556862 </p>
      <p class="p List1">b. The contractor then uses WAWF to create and submit the PCRR. Upon
      notification that the goods have been received, the Government acceptor
      accepts the PCRR in WAWF. The CH verifies that acceptance has occurred in
      PIEE/WAWF and that the contracting officer has approved the invoice. The
      CH submits the invoice, receiving report, copy of the contract and
      modifications, and a current obligation/disbursement sheet to the BO for
      approval. After acceptance of the property in WAWF, data will flow to the
      Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) based on the Pay DoDAAC<em class="ph i">.</em>
      Indicating “CRCARD” as the payment office prevents double obligation and
      data from entering the payment process. </p>
