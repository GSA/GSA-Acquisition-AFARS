of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology), through the

      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. Purchases of explosives, toxins, and ammunition
are authorized only after JPEO-A&amp;A has authorized an exception.
This specifically includes small arms, explosives, weapon parts,
accessories, and ammunition. Each exception is approved on a
case-by-case basis by JPEO A&amp;A and ODASA(P) CPM.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. Waiver requests may be submitted to JPEO

A&amp;A Waiver Request Checklist</a> along with the supporting
documentation identified below. Forward the waiver request and
supporting documentation to your Level 4 A/OPC.</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Justification for Waiver and Mission

        <p class="p List1">d. JPEO-A&amp;A provides a recommendation to
concur or non-concur with the waiver request to the ODASA(P) CPM.
If JPEO-A&amp;A concurs with the request and the request justifies
inclusion in the AFARS Appendix EE list of approved exceptions to
policy, the ODASA(P) will approve the waiver request. If
JPEO-A&amp;A non-concurs with the waiver request, JPEO-A&amp;A will
return the request with a non-concurrence to the requesting
organization. If the waiver request is approved by the ODASA(P),
the activity will be authorized the exception to policy in
compliance with Army policy.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. A dedicated GPC is mandatory for such approved
exceptions to policy. The dedicated GPC will be identified by a
third line embossing as “AMMO,” providing transparent
identification for ammunition purchases via GPC for Army reporting
purposes.</p>

organizations in AR 5-13 “Army Munitions Requirements,
Prioritization, and Authorizations Management Policy”

procuring NSA for their respective requirements and not requesting

        <p class="p List1">b. Policy memorandum for procurement of NSA dated
8 Aug 2008 establishes Army policy for NSA. This memorandum directs
all Army NSA procurements be forwarded to JPEO A&amp;A to execute.
If valid reasons exist, making it impractical for JPEO A&amp;A to
procure NSA, the procuring organization will coordinate with JPEO
A&amp;A in writing. The JPEO A&amp;A will have final approval
authority to allow other Army organizations to procure Non-Standard
Ammunition by following the exception to policy procedures in this
chapter.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. Procurement of Ammunition, Army (PAA) is the
<strong class="ph b">only</strong> appropriation authorized for ammunition
procurement within the Army. JPEO A&amp;A will make the
determination if any other funding may be used when using the GPC.
Alternatively, Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation
(RDT&amp;E) appropriations can be used to procure end items,
weapons, equipment, components, materials and services required for
development of equipment, material, or computer application
software, where applicable.</p>
