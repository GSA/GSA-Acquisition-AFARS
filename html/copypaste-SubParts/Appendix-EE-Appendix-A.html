The BO must confirm in writing the actual card assigned to the CH was returned and destroyed. During the annual review of a BO’s account, the BO will advise/recommend to the Level 4 A/OPC whether, based on mission requirements and purchase history, a continuing need for the GPC is justified for each assigned CH.</p>

The Level 4 A/OPC reviews and approves the spending limits the RM assigns to the CHs, and forwards to the bank the approved spending limits and merchant codes based on a reasonable estimation of what the CH needs to buy as part of the activity mission and function (RM setup for BOs/CHs in EAS). The spending limits and cycle limits must be set at a level commensurate with historical spending, anticipated requirements, and available funding of the activity or organization. Limits should not be based on unlikely contingencies.</p>

Obtaining a commercial product at a lower price than an AbilityOne product is not a valid reason to circumvent the AbilityOne Program mandate. If you feel the AbilityOne product is priced significantly higher than a commercial item, you should contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance. AbilityOne does not offer a general-use, white, 8.5 x 11 or 30% recycled copy paper. AbilityOne’s copy paper is for letterhead application and is archival quality. Since AbilityOne is not a mandatory source for a general-use paper (30% recycled is considered general use), you don’t need a waiver from AbilityOne for the purchase of general-use copy paper and may purchase from AbilityOne Base Supply Centers or another source such as the office supply BPAs on the DOD EMALL Army Corridor.</p>

The cardholder must provide a copy of the purchase receipt to the PBO within 5 days after receipt In rare situations where scarce human resources and operation readiness dictates, a PBO may be appointed as a CH or BO, but to ensure separation of duties, PBOs that are also BOs or CHs may not purchase items they use requiring property accountability.

If after coordination with the contracting authority for the deployed area, it is determined the deploying units are not taking their GPCs, these accounts must be temporarily suspended by the A/OPC, upon notification from the BO, during the period of deployment. If GPCs are authorized while deployed, the local RM must make appropriate adjustments to the lines of accounting/EDI flags and routers, and additional information must be entered in the Servicing Bank’s EAS.

The reserve issued GPC shall no longer be used. The Reserve A/OPC deactivates the mobilized soldier’s GPC account at this point, through temporary closure or termination. The gaining activity in the contingency operation area determines if a soldier requires a GPC. If it is determined that the mobilized reservist requires a GPC, the unit’s command identifies the FORSCOM home station responsible for its issuance. All GPC accounts (CH and BO) for mobilized reservists are managed by the FORSCOM home station installation A/OPC to which the contingency unit is assigned. Cards are to be used in theater for mission essential requirements only. The A/OPC provides a GPC CH worksheet to the CH to assist the CH with contingency purchases.</p>

In most cases, Appendix C allows the CH to determine whether a particular buy is appropriate. This list is not all-inclusive and should be supplemented by ACOM and installation GPC standard operating procedures, as necessary. In addition to the items listed in Appendix C, CHs must obtain pre-purchase approval and documentation addressing the bona fide need for requirements that appear to be outside the normal needs of the requesting organization. CHs must ensure that all purchases are properly documented, and that necessary approvals are obtained prior to making the purchase.</p>

If a CH determines that he or she must make a purchase from a source that has been blocked because of its assigned MCC, the following procedures apply. The request to override a merchant’s blocked MCC must be prepared by the BO of the CH who wants to make the purchase. The request must contain the name and masked account number (show only the last 10 digits of the account number) of the CH, a description of the item(s) to be purchased, the merchant’s exact name and address, the MCC that must be overridden, the estimated dollar amount of the purchase, the estimated date of the purchase, and a description of efforts to locate a source other than the merchant with the blocked MCC. In addition, the request must specify the need for the particular requirement (for example, a special magnifying glass, available only from a jewelry store, needed to examine circuit card wiring). The request is routed through the appropriate Level 4 A/OPC to the Level 3 A/OPC for approval. Approvals are granted on a transaction-by-transaction basis. This process does not allow recurring purchases from a restricted merchant. If the request is approved, the Level 4 A/OPC contacts the Servicing Bank to have the specific transaction approved from the restricted merchant. The CH has five days to make the purchase. At the time of purchase, the CH advises the merchant to call the Servicing Bank’s Customer Service Department and provide the following information:</p>

      </p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE-Appendix-A__xbiTPt">a. Monitoring and surveillance of the GPC program are shared responsibilities. All stakeholders in the program, including RMs, PBOs, and local audit and oversight organizations, have a part in ensuring that the GPC is used in the proper manner and only authorized and necessary official purchases are made. The Servicing Bank’s EAS gives all A/OPCs and RMs the capability to electronically review CH transaction details on a daily basis. This tool must be used to maintain the highest level of visibility over this program.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE-Appendix-A__AImsnq">b. Level 4 A/OPCs annually inspects 100% of Billing Officials and a representative, randomly selected sample of transactions of each BO account. Hands-on reviews are preferred, but alternative methods are allowable. The Level 4 A/OPCs reviews the selected transactions to verify that the BOs and CHs are following correct procedures and processes. The Level 4 A/OPCs are encouraged to include participation from representatives of the local Resource Management Office as well as other local oversight organizations in their surveillance programs. At a minimum, these reviews must address compliance with formal GPC purchase and payment procedures, appropriateness of spending limits, span of control, and property accountability. Review guidelines and checklists are provided in Appendix D. The A/OPC will utilize the surveillance tools in the Servicing Bank’s EAS.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE-Appendix-A__hQYcPo">c. The A/OPC performs an annual review of the ongoing need for existing cards and makes a determination to cancel or allow unused cards to remain open. Cards with no activity for more than 6 months should be cancelled or the continued need documented. An annual review of credit limits on each CH account must be performed and credit limits adjusted based on an analysis of individual CH expected usage or past spending patterns.</p>

A/OPC's and Financial Managers can view in Access Online which accounts have not been approved before U.S. Bank takes suspension action. By using the Managing Account Approval Status Report, you can see which accounts are still outstanding for any cycle. This report can be found in the Reports listing under – “Financial Management Reports”. Additionally, a faster method would be to scan the Managing Account List screen in Transaction Management for the cycle in question. Another report you can access is the “Past Due Report” by going through “Access Online Reporting-Program Management-Past Due”. Please ensure all A/OPCs and RMs take advantage of the Servicing Bank’s reporting capabilities to assist them in identifying and resolving delinquent accounts.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE-Appendix-A__p__Toc358795817">b. The Army goal is to pay all accounts on time. Level 4 A/OPCs who have a history of more than 5 percent of BO accounts delinquent during four or more billing cycles in the reporting period must report, on a semi-annual basis to their Level 3 A/OPCs, what corrective actions they have taken to improve payments. Delinquencies as a percentage of the outstanding balance due also should be tracked. The Army may not have more than 0.75 percent of its total receivables at the bank over 60 days past due. The Army maintains a zero tolerance for any percentage of receivables over 180 days past due.</p>
