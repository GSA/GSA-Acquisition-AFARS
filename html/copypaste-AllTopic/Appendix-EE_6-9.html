      <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">Payment Delinquency Monitoring</strong>. A/OPCs must track managing account
certification after the end of the billing cycle and confirm whether the
payments processed. A/OPCs can use the Managing Account Approval Status and
Certification and Payment Report reports to identify accounts that have not been
certified. The servicing bank may send reports of delinquencies and potential
past due accounts. A/OPCs can also use the Past Due report in the bank’s EAS to
identify delinquent accounts. Past due notices (delinquencies over 30 days) must
be handled immediately. GPC stakeholders must work together to research and
correct any delinquency immediately. Delinquencies that are 60 days past due are
suspended as outlined in paragraph 5-6.b. The Army goal is to pay all accounts
on time. The Army maintains a zero tolerance for any percentage of receivables
over 180 days past due.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. The A/OPC will monitor account certifications and may suspend any account
that is not certified within 5 business days. If the A/OPC suspends an account,
once the account is certified, the A/OPC may reinstate the account. If the bank
suspends an account, once the account is certified and paid, the account is
automatically reinstated. The request to reinstate a suspended account due to
non-certification, must include an explanation of the delay in certification and
a plan to avoid future delays. If the account has been suspended for late
certification more than once, any request to reinstate the account must come
from the activity responsible for the account.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Cardholder Statement Reconciliation and Certification</strong>. Cardholders
must match and approve transactions throughout the month to ensure accuracy and
identify and resolve any funding errors. If a charged amount is incorrect, the
CH must contact the vendor to resolve the discrepancy and may dispute the
transaction, if necessary. Cardholders must also upload transaction
documentation throughout the month to ensure BO visibility of purchase
information. If the statement is correct at the end of the billing cycle, the CH
must approve the statement within three business days of the billing cycle end
date. For Army agencies that do not utilize the bank's EAS for monthly
certification, per the DoD FMR, Vol 10 Chapter 23, Figure 23-2, the CH must
complete a monthly certification statement as part of their reconciliation
process.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Billing Official Certification</strong>. BOs must review their CHs’
transactions and ensure that all purchases are legal, proper, and correct.
Billing officials must final-approve their CHs’ transactions and certify the
billing statement within five business days of the billing cycle end date. If
the BO finds a questionable transaction, they should not certify the statement.
They should contact their A/OPC for further guidance. Billing officials must
certify in order for DFAS to process the payment and the bank to receive and
post the payment. Time certification is essential in order to avoid delinquency
and interest from late payments. For Army agencies that do not utilize the
bank’s EAS for monthly certification, per DoD FMR, Vol 10 Chapter 23, Figures
23-1 and 23-2, the BO must complete a monthly review checklist and certification
statement.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Confirm and Pay</strong>. The Army certifies invoices for payment after all
purchased items have been confirmed. This procedure is called “Confirm and Pay.”
Before certifying the billing statement, BOs should review the uploaded
transaction documentation to confirm that the items arrived or services were
performed. Each BO should ensure all transactions are reconciled and approved
for payment, receipt is verified, and all supporting documentation is loaded in
the bank’s EAS prior to certification. Any transactions that cannot be
reconciled and approved for payment, will not be approved in the bank’s EAS by
the BO. ANG and certain other Army accounts supporting the Air Force certify
invoices for payment following the Pay and Confirm model. For ANG payment
related guidance, see DAFI 64-117.</p>
