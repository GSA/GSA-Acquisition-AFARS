send files via file transfer must utilize GEX. DPCAP-approved
interfaces that leverage an application program interface to make
system-to-system calls are exempt from utilizing GEX as an
intermediary. “EDI” refers to the automated process for
receiving electronic transactions, obligations, invoice, receiving,
and other records from a card-issuing bank via GEX to the
accounting, ERP, DFAS, or other system. To ensure funding
confirmation and reconciliation information integrity, original
transactions/invoices will be maintained and cannot be altered.
Cardholders will not be able to alter their statements of account
once they approve them unless a BO returns a statement to a CH for
corrections. Billing officials and Certifying Officers will not be
able to alter billing statements (invoices) once they are

electronic certification process will be used to ensure that the
official (i.e., original, unaltered) electronic invoice is
traceable from the card-issuing bank through the certification and
entitlement processes and retained in a government record. The BO
will ensure any corrections or additions to the original invoice
(e.g., reallocations to different funding lines) are proper and the
payment totals have not changed. Altering a voucher that is already
certified invalidates the original certification. Known or
suspected fraudulent transactions not initiated by the authorized
CH will be reported as external fraud directly to the card-issuing
bank. When external fraud is properly reported to the bank, the
current card account must be closed and a new account issued. The
BO and A/OPC must be notified immediately, and the CH will comply
with the bank’s external fraud reporting procedures. <span class="ph" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-1__Toc149838217"></span>

includes capabilities to track and report training course

to complete training prior to appointment issuance. To promote
compliance with training requirements, JAM system validations
prohibit appointment of individuals who, if required for their
roles, have not completed CLG 0010 and CLG 006. A system interface
has been deployed to automatically record completion of all
required and recommended DAU courses.  When tracking training
in JAM, GPC Program PIEE users are not required to manually load
electronic copies of training certificates for courses that
automatically were recorded via the DAU/PIEE system interface
(i.e., DAU is listed as the “Source”). Data is
displayed in the JAM application and available through EDA Advance
Reporting with DAU listed as “DAU,” as the source is
directly from the system of record. Because DAU is the primary
source for validating course completion, when training completion
is recorded via the DAU interface, the trainee is not required to
provide a copy (electronic or paper) to GPC program management,
thereby reducing paperwork, improving auditability, and ensuring
proper record retention. PIEE additionally includes the
capability for GPC program participants to manually record
completion of non-DAU training and provide/maintain an electronic
copy of training certificates, which are then available to program
managers and auditors as necessary. DoD GPC One-Pagers <a class="xref" href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/asda/dpc/ce/pc/docs/training/3OP010_Uploading-Training-Certificates-to-PIEE-JAM.pptx" target="_blank">3OP010

compile all actions monthly without specifically identifying the

will provide the GPC data at a minimum annually, and GSA will
incorporate that data into FPDS for reports. This does not result
in duplicative FPDS reporting of GPC transactions, as GSA has
confirmed it reports only high-level data (i.e., total numbers of
transactions and dollars) outside the FPDS database. FPDS-NG

      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. WAWF is an application in the PIEE eBusiness
Suite used by contractors to invoice and by Government officials to
accept and certify for goods and services. Contractors must submit
contract invoices electronically, mandated by Public Law: Section
1008 of the NDAA of FY 2001. DFARS Clause 252.232-7003 (DFARS
232.7004) requires electronic invoicing and electronic supporting
documentation. WAWF allows vendors to submit and track invoices and
allows the Army to receive and accept those invoices over the Web,
enabling the Army to process those invoices in a real-time,
paperless environment. See paragraph 15-6 for more information.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">GPC Use of WAWF.</strong> When the GPC
is used as the method of payment on a contract, the contractor must
create a receiving report in WAWF. The Government acceptor must
then accept the receiving report in WAWF.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. WAWF users must register in <a class="xref" href="https://piee.eb.mil" target="_blank">
