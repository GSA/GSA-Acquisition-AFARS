      </p>
      <p class="p List3">(i)  When 5106.303-1-90 requires an amended justification, the contracting officer must prepare a document entitled “Amendment to Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition,” using the same paragraph designations used in the original justification.  Attach a copy of the original JRD and J&amp;A documents.  In addition—</p>
      <p class="p List4">(A)  Number amendments sequentially;</p>
      <p class="p List4">(B)  Include J&amp;A paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 in full, revised if required;</p>

      <p class="p List4">(E)  Address all remaining paragraphs of the J&amp;A by stating “No change” following the paragraph number or by inserting an entirely revised paragraph.  When there are minor changes, mark through deleted items and underline additions to the original paragraph to indicate changes to the original document.  For major revisions, including the addition of paragraphs that previously did not apply, instead of marking through and underlining, use paragraph 10 to identify the paragraph number and summarize the changes.  Include this information following the entry required by (D).</p>
      <p class="p List3">(ii)  Determine the approval level for an amended J&amp;A by using the cumulative dollar value of the amended justification, e.g., original J&amp;A value plus the amount of the change.</p>

Electronic transmission is preferred.  For electronic submission, indicate the lead point of contact and the alternate (name, phone number, email address).</p>
      <p class="p List2">(2)  Include with the justification the transmittal memorandum signed by the appropriate official, the current acquisition plan, and any other key documents related to the instant action.  The approval authority or his/her office may request a copy of the acquisition strategy, usually for large services or major weapons system contracts; business case analysis for performance based logistics and select Acquisition Category programs; or requirements validation separately.</p>
      <p class="p List1">(e)  <em class="ph i">Revisions.</em>  The Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army (Procurement) (ODASA (P)) action officer will return J&amp;As submitted for SPE approval when directed revisions cannot be accomplished within five business days.
