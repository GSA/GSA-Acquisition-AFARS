   <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title2">
      <span class="ph autonumber">10-1.</span> Policy and Use</h2>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. Convenience checks provide activities with the flexibility to issue checks
for payment of supplies and services to support mission needs when the vendor
doesn’t accept payment by GPC. Convenience checks may be used for purchases when
supplies or service are available for delivery or completion within 15 days,
whether at the contractor’s place of business or at destination.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. DoD policy has a goal to decrease convenience check usage on an annual
basis. The Army does not receive rebates or retain dispute rights on convenience
check purchases. The authority to maintain a convenience check account will be
justified on an individual organization basis and controlled and monitored by
the organization’s CCO. The number of convenience check accounts per
installation must be kept to a minimum. Convenience check accounts are available
only to organizations that maintain active GPC accounts in good standing.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. Convenience checks should only be used when the vendor does not accept the
GPC. Convenience checks may not be used to avoid the normal GPC payment process.
Before a check is issued, the paying agency must make every effort to use the
GPC, including making maximum efforts to find and use merchants that accept the
GPC.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Restrictions</strong>.</p>
      <p class="p">1) Checkwriters must not use checks for employee reimbursements, cash
advances, cash awards, travel-related transportation payments, or meals.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Convenience check purchases must not require detailed specifications or an
inspection report.</p>
      <p class="p">3) Convenience checks should not be used for recurring payments.</p>
      <p class="p">4) Convenience checks must not be used as a method of payment against
existing contract instruments.</p>
      <p class="p">5) Checks will not be issued as an “exchange-for-cash” vehicle to establish
cash funds. If merchants issue credits or refunds by cash or check, the funds
must be immediately credited to the account against which the purchase was
originally made.</p>
      <p class="p">6) The same purchase prohibitions that apply to the GPC apply to convenience
checks.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Micro-purchase Threshold</strong>. The MPTs for convenience checks are half
of the open market and contingency MPTs. See Table 1-2. Splitting payments
across multiple checks is prohibited if the total requirement will exceed the
applicable convenience check MPT. Checkwriters may use checks for purchases in
support of declared contingency events up to the applicable convenience check
MPT.</p>
      <p class="p List1">f. <strong class="ph b">Processing Fee</strong>. Convenience checks should be written for the exact
payment amount. The payment amount for a check does not include the servicing
bank’s administrative processing fee. The check processing fee is added by the
servicing bank during processing of the transaction, and the addition of the
processing fee is not considered a split requirement. Checkwriters should ensure
that the total funds obligated include both the payment amount and the
processing fee. The convenience check MPT is for the payment amount of the good
or service, which does not include the processing fee (e.g., a check may be
written up to $5,000; the processing fee is accounted for separately and is
charged separately on the billing statement).</p>
      <p class="p List1">g. <strong class="ph b">Security and Oversight</strong>. Convenience checks are negotiable
instruments and must be stored in a locked container, such as a safe or locking
filing cabinet. Checks must be accounted for appropriately to prevent loss,
theft, or potential forgery. Convenience check accounts must be reviewed
annually by a disinterested party and not the A/OPC.</p>
      <p class="p List1">h. Convenience checks are pre-numbered, and their use is controlled with a
separate convenience check purchase log for each account. Check purchases are
reconciled just as other GPC transactions, as a part of the monthly statement
billing cycle in the servicing bank’s EAS. Checkwriters must retain copies of
voided checks through the carbon copy or photocopy the original check as a part
of their file documentation.</p>
      <p class="p List1">i. <strong class="ph b">Disputes</strong>. The normal GPC dispute process is not applicable to
convenience checks. Concerns over a check purchase must be resolved directly
with the merchant. The checkwriter is responsible for securing credits or
resolving problems with the merchant. Each organization is responsible for all
checks written on an account, unless it is determined fraud is involved. In some
cases, payments can be stopped on a convenience check that has been written if
the check has not yet been posted to an account. To stop payment on a check, the
checkwriter must call the servicing bank’s customer service department to
receive instructions on processing the action.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">10-2.</span> Establishing a Convenience Check Account</h2>
  <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. Convenience check accounts are dedicated accounts and must be maintained separately from the GPC account. Cardholders may have both a regular GPC account and a separate convenience check account. Checkwriters must ensure that payee information on the convenience check is <strong class="ph b">written legibly</strong>. Convenience checks are not to be used for recurring payments.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. Any U.S. Government employee, military or civilian, including local national employees, may be selected for appointment as a checkwriter. Traditional part-time National Guard members cannot be checkwriters. Contractors working for the Army cannot be checkwriters.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. Requests to establish convenience check accounts must be justified in writing by the organization and forwarded to the Level 4 A/OPC. Required information must consist of the following:</p>
      <p class="p">1) Reason for requesting checks</p>
      <p class="p">2) Types of vendors to which the checks would be written</p>
      <p class="p">3) Estimated dollar amount of checks intended to be written within a 12-month period</p>
      <p class="p">4) Single and monthly purchase limits</p>
      <p class="p">5) Checkwriter’s complete name, office name, address, email, phone/fax number</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. Checkwriters must be appointed in PIEE/JAM with the “Micro-Purchase Convenience Check Writer” designation. The checkwriter is the only person who has the authority to issue and sign checks.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">10-3.</span> Convenience Check Reporting (IRS Form 1099)</h2>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. IRS requires DoD federal agencies to report convenience check payments as
income. See 26 USC 6041, 6041A, and 6045. IRS Form 1099 must be issued to check
recipients for certain payment types. (Refer to <a class="xref" href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1099msc.pdf" target="_blank">IRS Instructions for Form 1099 - MISC</a> for more detail
regarding payment types that are not reportable to DFAS.) Convenience check data
must be reported to the IRS as income to the check recipients. IRS matches the
reported data to the check recipients’ tax returns to ensure income is
reported.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Tax Reporting</strong>. The DFAS Tax Office emails convenience check
purchasing data to the checkwriters for verification on a monthly basis. The
email contains a spreadsheet, instructions, and the suspense date for return.
Upon receipt of the spreadsheet, checkwriters must update the required columns
and email the spreadsheet to the following mailbox: <a class="xref" href="mailto:dfas.cco-checks@mail.mil" target="_blank">DFAS 1099 Check Writer Reporting</a> within five business
days upon receipt. This data is used to process IRS 1099-MISC forms. The BO is
responsible to monitor the checkwriter's compliance. BOs and checkwriters who do
not return the requested information to DFAS are responsible for their own tax
form issuance and IRS tax reporting. Instructions for submitting convenience
check 1099 tax reporting information is available on the <a class="xref" href="https://www.dfas.mil/contractorsvendors/taxinfo/Convenience-Check-1099PRO/" target="_blank">DFAS Office Website</a>.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. Checkwriters will obtain the vendor information and W-9 required for tax
reporting before paying the vendor, as stated in DoD 7000-14R FMR 26 Volume 10,
Chapter 6, 060209. The checkwriter is responsible for tax reporting for the
convenience checks they issue and for obtaining a signed IRS Form W9, Request
for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. DFAS ESS Tax Office will perform the following actions:</p>
      <p class="p">1) Provide monthly spreadsheets containing the servicing bank’s universe of
convenience check payment data to A/OPCs, BOs, and checkwriters for completion
of additional information.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Provide tax reporting guidance to checkwriters.</p>
      <p class="p">3) Aggregate the payment data to determine tax form issuance and issue tax
forms to check recipients.</p>
      <p class="p">4) Electronically report the payment data to the IRS.</p>
      <p class="p">5) Provide report to A/OPCs, BOs, and checkwriters of data that resulted in
tax form issuance.</p>
      <p class="p">6) Provide customer service to tax form recipients.</p>
      <p class="p">7) Issue corrected tax forms.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. A/OPCs, Billing Officials, and Checkwriters will perform the following
actions:</p>
      <p class="p">1) Supplement the payment data with the necessary reporting data, annotate
payment as reportable or not reportable, and return spreadsheets to tax
office.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Maintain and update points of contact in the U.S. Bank account.</p>
      <p class="p">3) Maintain final summarized spreadsheet provided by DFAS and copies of the
check registers for audit purposes.</p>
      <p class="p">4) Have a signed W-9 from vendors on file.</p>
      <p class="p">5) Ensure that spreadsheets are completed correctly and returned by
deadline.</p>
      <p class="p List1">f. The checkwriter must complete the following fields in the DFAS
spreadsheet:</p>
      <p class="p">1) <strong class="ph b">Payment Description</strong>. Define the purpose of the payment to the
vendor.</p>
      <p class="p">2) <strong class="ph b">Yes or No Reportable Transaction</strong>. Indicate whether vendor and
payment type are tax reportable. “Yes” is reportable. “No” is not
reportable.</p>
      <p class="p">3) For all tax reportable payments, complete the following fields:</p>
      <p class="p">(a) Vendor’s Taxpayer Identification Number: SSN, EIN, ITIN</p>
      <p class="p">(b) Vendor’s Name and Doing Business As Name</p>
      <p class="p">(c) Vendor’s Current mailing address</p>
      <p class="p">(d) Vendor’s City</p>
      <p class="p">(e) Vendor’s State</p>
      <p class="p">(f) Vendor’s Zip Code</p>
      <p class="p">(g) Vendor’s Country</p>
      <p class="p">(h) Indicate the payment amount in <strong class="ph b">one</strong> of the following fields, as
applicable:</p>
      <p class="p">(1) Check paid for Rents, Rentals, Leases</p>
      <p class="p">(2) Check paid for Royalties</p>
      <p class="p">(3) Check paid to individual for medical research</p>
      <p class="p">(4) Check Paid for Medical/Dental Services</p>
      <p class="p">(5) Check paid to a vendor or individual not Government employee</p>
      <p class="p">(6) Check paid for Attorney Fees</p>

  <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title5">
      <span class="ph autonumber">10-4.</span> Before Writing a Convenience Check</h2>
  <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">IRS Form W-9.</strong> Before writing a convenience check, the checkwriter must always obtain an IRS Form W-9 to ensure possession of all information required for tax form issuance.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. DFAS recommends not writing checks to foreign vendors. When writing a check to a foreign vendor, an IRS Form W-8 is required before payment. To determine which W-8 form is used, see IRS Publication 515, Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Entities. To determine if tax withholding and tax deposits to the IRS are required, see IRS Publication 515, Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Entities and/or IRS Publication 901, U.S. Tax Treaties.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. If a U.S. vendor refuses to provide their TIN and it is a tax reportable payment, IRS states to backup withhold 24% and deposit with IRS. See IRS Publication 1281, Backup Withholding for Missing and Incorrect Name/TIN(s).</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. Consider alternative payment methods. See the <a class="xref" href="https://smartpay.gsa.gov/sites/default/files/downloads/SP%20Convenience%20Checks%20Slipsheet%20508.pdf" target="_blank">GSA Payment Solutions Brochure</a> for alternatives to using convenience checks. A good alternative to the convenience check process is using the miscellaneous payment process or using a vendor that accepts the GPC.</p>

  <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title6">
      <span class="ph autonumber">10-5.</span> Why Decrease Use of Convenience Checks?</h2>
  <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">No Refunds</strong>. Check transactions do not receive refunds otherwise
      provided on by use of the GPC.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Minimized fraud</strong>. Checks often do not require signature
      verification, which could lead to fraudulent transactions. In addition,
      they do not carry the same “paper trail” as other electronic payment
      methods, which may lead to misuse.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Streamlined processes</strong>. Electronic payments, like the GPC, help
      facilitate smoother transactions, enhance transparency, save time, and
      lead to improved data monitoring capabilities.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Green initiatives</strong>. Electronic payments help reduce paper usage
      and aid agencies in meeting their sustainability goals. Records also
      reside in a central location which will make it easier to locate and
      verify information.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Increased consumer protection</strong>. The GPC provides the opportunity
      for a much quicker reimbursement to a customer who may be unsatisfied with
      a product or service or who is charged incorrectly.</p>
      <p class="p List1">f. <strong class="ph b">Less hassle</strong>. Check transactions must be reported to the IRS
      using a 1099 form. Alternatively, in accordance with Section 6050W of the
      Housing Assistance Tax Act (Public Law 110-289), agencies are no longer
      required to report charge card transactions to the IRS using the 1099
      form.</p>
      <p class="p List1">g. <strong class="ph b">Time and Cost Savings</strong>. Utilizing a GPC instead of a convenience
      check delivers tremendous time and cost savings, leaving more time for
      mission-critical activities.</p>
      <p class="p List1">h. <strong class="ph b">Improved merchant-client relationship</strong>. When a GPC is used,
      merchants are paid within three days of the transaction. They receive a
      guaranteed payment and as a result, are able to provide greater security,
      reports, and data to the customer. This increases satisfaction on both
      sides of the transaction.</p>
