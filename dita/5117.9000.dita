In general, proposed projects valued at $2,000 or less are considered inappropriate for ordering under JOC because of the administrative costs associated with processing JOC orders and the simplified purchase methods available for these actions.  <i>[AFARS Revision #15, dated February 17, 2005]</i></p><p outputclass="List1">(b)  Additional information on executing JOC is found in the JOC Guide published by the JOC Steering Committee.  The guide may be obtained from Assistant Chief Of Staff (Installation Management), Attn:  DAIM-FDF-M, 7701 Telegraph Road, Bldg. 2594, Alexandria, VA 22315-3800.</p></conbody></concept>
