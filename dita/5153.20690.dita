Contracting officers will tailor the justification review document format to accommodate the justification’s approval threshold.  For example, justifications approved by a contracting officer may not require command advocate for competition, senior contracting official or head of the contracting activity review.  The completed format becomes the cover page(s) of the justification.  Do not use letterhead for this document.</p></conbody></concept>
