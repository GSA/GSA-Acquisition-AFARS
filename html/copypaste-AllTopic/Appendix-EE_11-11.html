        <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">Identifying the Violation</strong>. DoD’s <a class="xref" href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/policy/policyvault/Final_GPC_Disciplinary_Category_Definitions_Guidance_Jan_27_2020.pdf" target="_blank">GPC Disciplinary Category Definitions
            Guidance</a> is a helpful resource when identifying the type of
            violation in situations of card misuse and abuse. See Table 11-4
            below.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. A/OPCs should be alert to the following indicators of possible
            fraud, waste, or abuse:</p>
        <p class="p">1) Repetitive buys from the same merchant</p>
        <p class="p">2) Lack of documentation for a purchase</p>
        <p class="p">3) Failure to safeguard cards and account numbers</p>
        <p class="p">4) CH or BO authorizing the use of their cards by others</p>
        <p class="p">5) Inadequate oversight by BOs and agencies</p>
        <p class="p">6) Payments made for items not received</p>
        <p class="p">7) Split purchases to avoid spending limitations</p>
        <p class="p">8) Lack of accounting for items requiring accountability</p>
        <p class="p">9) Payment delinquencies incurring interest penalties</p>
        <p class="p">10) Approval of a CH’s statement of account by someone other than the
            CH or BO</p>
        <p class="p">11) Unauthorized purchases</p>
        <p class="p">12) CHs returning merchandise for cash or store credit vs. having
            credits issued back to the GPC</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Taking Corrective Action</strong>. When an A/OPC discovers a
            violation of GPC policies, the A/OPC must take corrective action.
            The course of action will vary depending on the intentionality and
            severity of the infraction. A/OPCs should take one or more of the
            following corrective actions:</p>
        <p class="p">1) Document the violation in the purchase file and/or CH or BO’s
            file.</p>
        <p class="p">2) Require involved parties to attend training.</p>
        <p class="p">3) Inform the involved parties’ supervisor or commander.</p>
        <p class="p">4) Suspend CH or BO account.</p>
        <p class="p">5) Terminate CH or BO appointment and account.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Continual or Severe Violations</strong>. Continual violation of GPC
            procedures by a CH or BO will result in termination of GPC
            privileges. A/OPCs will document the violation and action taken in
            their files for that particular CH/BO. A/OPCs will refer evidence of
            deliberate abuse to the CH and/or BO’s supervisor, Commander, or SCO
            for appropriate action in accordance with the Uniform Code of
            Military Justice or civilian disciplinary rules. A/OPC will refer
            evidence of internal fraud or other criminal activity to the
            Commander or SCO.
