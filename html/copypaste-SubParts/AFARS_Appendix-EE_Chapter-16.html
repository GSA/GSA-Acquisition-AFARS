  <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p"> </p>
      <p class="p List1">a. Purchases of explosives, toxins, and ammunition are authorized only after the Joint Program Executive Office Armaments and Ammunition (JPEO-A&amp;A) has authorized an exception. This specifically includes small arms, explosives, weapon parts, accessories, and ammunition. Each exception is approved on a case-by-case basis by JPEO A&amp;A and ODASA(P) CPM.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. Waiver requests may be submitted to JPEO A&amp;A via use of the JPEO A&amp;A Waiver Request Checklist and the following documents to the Level 4 A/OPC: </p>
      <p class="p">1) Justification for Waiver and Mission Requirements stated in a signed memorandum on the requesting organization’s official letterhead</p>
      <p class="p">2) Internal Controls (safe storage)</p>

      <p class="p List1">c. The Level 4 A/OPC will submit the completed request packet to the Level 3 A/OPC for submission to JPEO-A&amp;A and the Army GPC CPM for review/approval.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. JPEO-A&amp;A provides a recommendation on whether or not the request justifies inclusion in the AFARS Appendix EE list of approved exceptions to policy to the CPM or returns the request with a non-concurrence to the requesting organization. If approved, by the ODASA(P), the activity will be authorized the exception to policy. The approved exception will be added to the requester’s local GPC Operating Procedures. </p>
      <p class="p List1">e. A dedicated GPC is mandatory for such approved exceptions to policy. The dedicated GPC will be identified by a third line embossing as “AMMO,” providing transparent identification for ammunition purchases via GPC for Army reporting purposes.</p>

        <p class="p List1">a. The Deputy Chief of Staff (DCS) G – 37/TRA validates and
            authorizes all NSA requirements except for organizations in AR 5-13
            “Army Munitions Requirements, Prioritization, and Authorizations
            Management Policy” paragraphs 2–1b and 2-7 of this regulation, when
            they are procuring NSA for their respective requirements and not
            requesting NSA from Army inventory.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. Policy memorandum for procurement of NSA dated 8 Aug 2008
            establishes U.S. Army policy for NSA. This memorandum directs all
            U.S. Army NSA procurements be forwarded to Program Executive Office
            Ammunition that has become JPEO A&amp;A to execute. If valid reasons
            exist, making it impractical for JPEO A&amp;A to procure NSA, the
            procuring organization will coordinate with JPEO A&amp;A in writing.
            The JPEO A&amp;A will have final approval authority to allow other
            U.S. Army organizations to procure Non-Standard Ammunition by
            following the exception to policy procedures in this chapter.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. Procurement of Ammunition, Army (PAA) is the only appropriation
            authorized for ammunition procurement within the Army. JPEO A&amp;A
            will make the determination if any other funding may be used when
            using the GPC. Alternatively, Research, Development, Test, and
            Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) appropriations can be used to procure end
            items, weapons, equipment, components, materials and services
            required for development of equipment, material, or computer
            application software, where applicable, per reference 1c. </p>
