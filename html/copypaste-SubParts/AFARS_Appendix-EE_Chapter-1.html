   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-1__monHHk">a. This document provides the procedures to be used within the Army to establish and manage the Army Government Purchase Card (GPC) program. Best practices are identified in Appendix A. Army activities may adopt more stringent internal control requirements than the requirements cited herein. However, as these are risk-managed programs, activities should maintain a proper balance between the control environment and ease of use to ensure that the benefits of the card continue to accrue. These procedures establish Army-wide standards designed to provide all Army activities with a foundation upon which to build specific standard operating procedures governing their programs.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-1__RVbCpG">b. Nonappropriated activities implement policies and procedures governing the Army’s morale, welfare, and recreation programs and general policies on Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities (NAFI). Chaplaincy activities implement policies and procedures governing Army Chaplain Corps activities. Army NAFIs/entities must operate within the parameters of these procedures.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-5__UmWUgf">a. The Chief of the Contracting Office (CCO) shall delegate micro-purchase procurement authority to individuals at the lowest level in accordance with FAR Part 1-603-3(b). This authority may be redelegated in writing to the Level 3 or 4 Agency/Organization Program Coordinator (A/OPC). Sample appointment letters are located at Appendix F.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-5__rTEoUV">b. Orientation and training on the Army purchase card program is a prerequisite to receiving a GPC.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-5__hqLJds">c. Generally, only government employees can be cardholders. However, a number of exceptions apply:</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-5__mrIhkK">(1) Under certain conditions, GSA can authorize contractors to establish cards directly with the issuing bank, if necessary. (DOD Guidebook page A-1). Requests for GPC by contractors working under cost type contracts shall be forwarded to the Army contracting officer for the cost-reimbursable contract. If the contracting officer determines that the contractors are eligible, the contractors must file a Request for Eligibility Determination with the GSA SmartPay contracting officer. (AFARS 5113.202-90(b)).</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-5__bILLDj">(2) Foreign nationals may be designated as accountable officials - Billing Officials (BOs) and Cardholders (CHs) provided they are direct hires, even though they may not be subject to pecuniary liability under U.S. law. Given the above, purchase cards may be issued to foreign national employees of the Army if they meet accountable official requirements (nomination and training). They are subject to the same disciplinary actions for card misuse as U.S. citizen employees, subject to host country agreements and local law. (DOD Guidebook page A-1 and DOD FMR Volume 5, Chapter 33, paragraph 330204)</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-5__zIoQkl">(3) Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC) Instructors are members of the Armed Forces in accordance with AR 145-2, paragraph 4-3, and may be designated micro-purchase procurement authority as GPC cardholders. (FAR Part 1-603-3(b))</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-5__oLXRDv">d. Army cardholders who are ordering officers may be authorized to use the GPC as a payment instrument for orders made against Federal Supply Schedule contracts (FSS), Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs), DOD Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts that contain a provision authorizing payment by purchase card, or other contracts when authorized by the contracting officer.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-5__YXgFNH">e. The GPC may provide a streamlined way of paying for contracts and other contracts than those listed above, but a contracting officer shall first determine that use of the GPC is in the best interest of the government (AFARS 5113.202-90(d)). See FAR Subpart 32.1110(d) and 32.1108 for instructions for use of the appropriate clause when payment under a written contract is made through use of the card. If payment under a written contract is made by the GPC, then the contracting officer shall insert the FAR clause 52.232-36, Payment by Third Party, in solicitations and contracts. Payment by a purchase card may also be made under a contract that does not contain the clause at 52.232-36, to the extent the contractor agrees to accept that method of payment. When the clause at 52.232-36 is included in a solicitation or contract, the contracting officer shall also insert the clause at 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer—Central Contractor Registration, or 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer—Other Than Central Contractor Registration, as appropriate.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-5__OOIisZ">f. The maximum single transaction dollar limit for the GPC for stand-alone purchases shall be the micro-purchase threshold as defined at FAR 2.101, DFARS 213.301(2) and AFARS 5113.270-90. The maximum single transaction dollar limit for contract payments against existing contracts shall be as identified in the contract and shall be within the limits defined in the CH written Delegation of Authority letter or the contracting officer’s warrant. In the event of an emergency need for contingency or humanitarian aid operations, the Executive Office of the President may sign into law an emergency procurement authority allowing increased GPC and convenience check limits and revised procedures in support of contingency and humanitarian aid operations. In such circumstances, the Director of Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy also may authorize class deviations to allow organizations to deviate from the FAR and DFARS. Such deviations may include raising GPC spending limits. These contingency/emergency purchases require separate training and Delegation of Authority by the A/OPC on contingency/emergency procedures and authority must be issued/granted by the Chief of Contracting or other authorized person.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-5__YRQWnC">g. The GPC shall be used to pay for government-owned material or government-performed services received from other government sources (e.g. Defense Logistics Agency Document Services, GSA Global, and Defense Logistics Agency).</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-5__qykaJC">h. The GPC shall be used as a method of payment for all commercial training $25,000 and below. The Standard Form (SF) 182 must be completed for training up to $25,000. If training costs exceed $25,000, submit the training requirement to your local contracting office. A separate and dedicated training GPC card must be issued and used to purchase training. These GPC training cards are only used to purchase training requirements.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-5__LMbhDO">i.Where it is identified that the purchase is processed via a third party merchant (such as PayPal), the CH should make every attempt to choose another merchant with whom to procure the goods and/or services. If found necessary to procure using a third party payment merchant, the BO must ensure adequate supporting documentation showing that there was a detailed review of the purchase and that the use of the third party payment merchant was unavoidable.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-6__gqlmpI">These procedures apply to all GPC purchases with cards issued by the Army. Non-Army tenant organizations issued Army GPCs or convenience checks by an Army contracting office are also subject to these procedures. All BOs, CHs, A/OPCs (at all levels), Resource Managers (RMs), Logisticians, and other stakeholders that participate in the GSA SmartPay Purchase Card Program under the Army Level 2 hierarchy are subject to these procedures. The policy established in this document supersedes previous guidance issued in the Draft Army Regulation (AR715-xx). Explanation of the Army level hierarchy is provided at 1-8.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-8__kudjip">a. Responsibility for the establishment and operation of an agency’s GPC program is delegated to the agency’s Senior Contracting Official (SCO). The SCO, or in activities that do not have a SCO, the Chief of the Contracting Office (CCO), designates a Level 3 A/OPC and an alternate(s) who once appointed is dedicated to the GPC Program within their agency/organization.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-8__gQmCGf">b. The SCO or CCO forwards the Level 3 A/OPC Appointment Letter to the Level 2 A/OPC using the template found at Appendix F. The letter delegates responsibility for managing the agency GPC program and details responsibilities, training and certification requirements, and grade level preferences for the Level 3 A/OPC role. The Level 2 A/OPC reviews the nomination and ensures the Level 3 A/OPC meets all requirements of the position. Once approved, the Level 2 A/OPC provides written endorsement and coordinates Level 3 A/OPC appointment with the servicing bank. The Level 2 A/OPC is the final approval authority for agency Level 3 A/OPC appointments.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-8__VuEREK">c. SCOs must ensure adequate resources are dedicated to the GPC program within their agency/organization to ensure successful management of the program. Adequate GPC resources refer to an agency’s efficient and effective deployment of assets (such as number of personnel, training, funding, facilities, knowledge and skills, etc.) when and where needed to meet agency requirements in compliance with the laws and regulations governing the GPC Program. Adequate resources must be deployed to reasonably ensure that programs achieve their intended results; resources are used consistent with agency mission; programs and resources are protected from fraud, waste, and mismanagement; laws and regulations are followed; and reliable and timely information is obtained, maintained, reported and used for decision making.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-8__IsgsgH">d. Individuals meeting the following criteria may be appointed as Level 3 or 4 A/OPCs for the GPC Program; GPC knowledge, training, and experience, basic contracting knowledge and/or acquisition training. The Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA) requires the Department of Defense to establish education and training standards, requirements, and courses for the civilian and military workforce. The DAWIA certification requirements are located at <a class="xref" href="https://dap.dau.mil/career/pur/Pages/Certification.aspx" target="_blank">
            <u class="ph u">DAU Certification Requirements</u>
         </a>. DAWIA contracting or purchasing certification includes a training, education, and experience requirement. The Army requires Level 3 and Level 4 A/OPCs to be DAWIA Level II certified in contracting. A/OPCs that are not DAWIA Level 2 certified in contracting must either complete the DAWIA Level 2 contracting training requirement within 24 months or achieve DAWIA Level 2 certification in purchasing within 24 months of being assigned to the Level 3 or Level 4 A/OPC position. This requirement is effective immediately upon appointment of all A/OPCs. Although the Level 3 A/OPC position typically warrants a minimum equivalent grade of GS-13 or higher, the grade depends on the responsibilities, complexity, and volume of the program. In addition to certification requirements, Level 3 and 4 A/OPCs are required to have completed the training requirements detailed in Section 2-2.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-8__fLrMqp">e. The SCO management responsibility authority for the GPC Program is further delegated to the CCO. The CCO must ensure adequate resources are dedicated to the GPC program within their installation/activity to allow effective administration of the program. The CCO coordinates with the local personnel office(s) to ensure procedures are established requiring individuals involved in the GPC Program to clear through the Level 4 A/OPC when they out-process from the installation. The Level 4 A/OPC is appointed at a sufficient grade/rank to exercise their authority depending on the responsibilities, complexity, and volume of the program. Only individuals who meet the criteria in paragraphs 1-8(d) may be appointed as A/OPCs for the GPC Program.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-8__pFVgKL">a. The Level 3 and 4 A/OPCs must have the following knowledge, skills, and abilities:</p>
