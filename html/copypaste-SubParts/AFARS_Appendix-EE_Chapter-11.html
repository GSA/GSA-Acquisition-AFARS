      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. Effective internal controls are essential to
reducing the risk inherent in the Army GPC Program and maintaining
its integrity and accountability. Internal controls are necessary
to ensure the achievement of organizational objectives; operational
effectiveness and efficiency; reliable financial reporting; and
compliance with laws, regulations, and policies. The Army has
established a series of automated and manual internal controls and
oversight procedures designed to identify and mitigate risk,
document the effectiveness of controls, and provide data to
effectively target corrective actions where and when needed.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. A key portion of the automated oversight
process, the SAHAR, provides the HCA/SCO with a high-level summary
of the scope, internal control effectiveness, level of risk, and
corrective actions implemented or required across the Army GPC
program. One of the major strengths of these controls and
procedures is the aggressive inclusion of automation applied to
control points, data-mining, and reporting that enforce laws,
regulation, and policy, reducing the administrative cost of
effective oversight.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. Automation is incorporated in the
control/oversight/reporting process through several integrated
applications sharing data throughout the entire process, from
automated identity verification and supervisor approval in PIEE, to
training reports from DAU to PIEE, to JAM appointments with
purchase limitations communicated to the card-issuing bank for
account establishment, to transaction information data-mined in
IOD, and automated reporting across the entire scope of the
process. This extensive automation increases the efficiency,
accuracy, auditability, and reliability of the oversight process
and the integrity and safety of the GPC Program.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. GPC management officials are responsible for
establishing a process of internal controls that (1) provides
reasonable assurance that the GPC program is used efficiently,
effectively, and legally to help manage the program and reduce
violations; and (2) complies with applicable laws and regulations.
Management should periodically review their GPC program’s
internal controls and avail themselves of the Monthly A/OPC Review
and SAHAR reports, along with any other reports, to ensure the
internal controls covered in specified reports are being followed
and GPC program participants are performing responsibly.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">11-2.</span> Three-Pronged Oversight Review
Process</h2>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. Surveillance and oversight of the GPC program
are a shared responsibility. All stakeholders in the program,
including requiring offices, RMs, logistics, contracting, and local
audit and oversight organizations, are responsible for ensuring
that the GPC is used in the proper manner and only authorized and
necessary official purchases are made. Organizations should develop
and follow a monitoring and oversight plan that establishes
frequencies, methods, participation, etc.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. Oversight is conducted to:</p>
      <p class="p List2">1) Validate and promote compliance with existing
internal controls;</p>
      <p class="p List2">2) Identify, report, and resolve systemic material
program weaknesses; and</p>
      <p class="p List2">3) Measure the effectiveness of internal
controls.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. To improve auditability of GPC program
oversight and realize the cost and other benefits of using the
commercially available SP3 technology, DoD uses the integrated
three-pronged, system-enabled review cycle depicted in Figure
11-1.</p>
      <p class="p" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_11-2__Toc174981137">Figure 11-1: Three-Pronged Oversight
Review Cycle</p>

         <img class="image" src="Graphics/image3.png" alt="Text Description automatically generated"> 
      </p>
      <p class="p List1">d. The three-pronged review cycle supplements
existing GPC operational transaction management and account
reconciliation and review processes, including:</p>
      <p class="p List2">1) Cardholder-obtained purchasing approvals (e.g.,
BO pre-purchase approval, special item approval, availability of
appropriate and sufficient funds);</p>
      <p class="p List2">2) Cardholder matching and approval of orders to
transactions and monthly statement approval;</p>
      <p class="p List2">3) Billing official monthly certification of the
managing account billing statement;</p>
      <p class="p List2">4) Resource manager funds certification;</p>
      <p class="p List2">5) A/OPC ongoing oversight and policy compliance
efforts; and</p>
      <p class="p List2">6) Disbursing office funds validation and
disbursement processing.</p>
      <p class="p">The cycle also supplements and informs both the periodic reviews
of Army contracting offices (e.g., Army PMRs or DCMA-led PMRs)
conducted to assess the effectiveness of the contracting function,
and the GPC governance processes conducted to evaluate and improve
the effectiveness of GPC internal controls.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Data analytics.</strong> Data analytics
is the application of electronic tools (software and/or systems)
for automated data sorting, filtering and mining techniques using
self-learning algorithms to search GPC transaction data in order to
identify patterns, trends, risks, opportunities and other
information. A/OPCs should use data analytics tools to assist them
in the management and oversight of their GPC program.</p>
      <p class="p List1">f. The Army uses preventive, detective, and
directive controls to monitor the GPC program.</p>
      <p class="p List2">1) Preventive controls are designed to discourage
errors or irregularities from occurring (e.g., processing a
transaction only after it has been properly approved by the
appropriate personnel).</p>
      <p class="p List2">2) Detective controls are designed to find errors
or irregularities after they have occurred (e.g., IOD data mining,
approving statements, and reconciling monthly invoices).</p>
      <p class="p List2">3) Directive controls are designed to encourage a
desirable event (e.g., written policies and procedures to assist in
compliance and the accomplishment of the goals and objectives of
the GPC program).</p>
      <p class="p List1">g. The HCA/SCO and A/OPCs are responsible for
adhering to the requirements specified in OMB Circular A-123,
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Control. The HCA/SCO
and A/OPCs are also responsible for adhering to the requirements
specified in 10 USC 4754 (as modified by Public Law 112–194,
Government Charge Card Abuse Prevention Act of 2012). These
statutory requirements mandate the following actions (list not
comprehensive):</p>
      <p class="p List2">1) Using effective systems, techniques, and
technologies to prevent or identify improper purchases.</p>
      <p class="p List2">2) Invalidating GPCs from each employee who ceases
to be employed by the Government or separates from Military
Service.</p>
      <p class="p List2">3) Taking steps to recover the cost of any
illegal, improper, or erroneous purchases made with a purchase card
or convenience check made by an employee or member of the armed
forces, including, as necessary, through salary offsets.</p>
      <p class="p List2">4) Taking appropriate adverse personnel actions or
imposing other punishments when employees of the Army violate
regulations governing the use and control of purchase cards and
convenience checks or who are negligent or engage in misuse, abuse,
or fraud with respect to a purchase card, including removal in
appropriate cases. Violations of such regulations by a person
subject to 10 USC Chapter 47, the Uniform Code of Military Justice
(UCMJ), is punishable as a violation of section 892 of article 92
of the UCMJ.</p>
      <p class="p List2">5) Requiring the Army Audit Agency to conduct
periodic audits or reviews of GPC programs to identify and analyze
risks of illegal, improper, or erroneous purchases and payments and
report the result to the Director of the OMB and Congress.</p>
      <p class="p List2">6) A/OPCs must provide monitoring, oversight,
training, and administration of all BOs and CHs. Supervisors and
BOs are responsible for the monitoring and oversight of BOs and CHs
under their purview.</p>
      <p class="p List1">h. To minimize losses to the Army, the program
must have an expectation of high integrity and ethical behavior
from all participants, and sufficient staff to perform the
following functions:</p>
      <p class="p List2">1) Conduct periodic risk assessments to identify
fraud, waste, and abuse and establish specific controls to
reasonably ensure that losses from these risks are minimized, to
include data mining.</p>
      <p class="p List2">2) Conduct proper training and complete reporting
and data analysis to ensure personnel have the skills and
information needed to be effective in their positions.</p>
      <p class="p List2">3) Conduct detailed, effective management and
oversight.</p>
      <p class="p List2">4) Implement corrective actions when cardholder
management is non-compliant with Army policies and procedures.</p>
      <p class="p List1">i. DPCAP will rely on the signed Semi-Annual HA
data provided by CPMs to accomplish DoD GPC reporting required by
OMB. DPCAP updates visual trending of statistical and violation
information to identify trends in GPC use and variances and shares
this information with the Army during the GPC CPM Monthly
Calls.</p>
      <p class="p List1">j. The GPC Integrated Solutions Team (IST) is
DoD’s GPC governance body. IST membership consists of a GPC
Governance Board composed of representatives from DPCAP, Army,
Navy, Air Force, other Defense agencies, and supported by the bank
team. The bank team consists of U.S. Bank (card-issuing bank),
MasterCard (card association), and Oversight Systems (data mining
vendor). The IST typically meets semi-annually to achieve the
following:</p>
      <p class="p List2">1) Review trends and changes in the GPC industry
and the DoD GPC Program.</p>
      <p class="p List2">2) Identify and approve any necessary adjustments
to the bank team's electronic capabilities, DoD’s GPC
enterprise tools, and/or DoD GPC policies.</p>
      <p class="p List2">3) Identify and approve changes to the DM rules
and system parameter settings.</p>
      <p class="p List2">4) Bring efficiencies to the Program by adjusting
the business rules/parameters based on transaction risk.</p>
      <p class="p List2">5) Review trends and changes in the GPC industry
and the DoD GPC Program.</p>
      <p class="p List2">6) Identify any necessary adjustments to the bank
team's electronic capabilities, DoD’s GPC enterprise tools,
and/or DoD GPC policies.</p>
      <p class="p List2">7) Identify and approving changes to the Data
Mining rules.</p>
      <p class="p List2">8) Review relevant data mining case information
and recommendations provided by the bank team (e.g., percentage of
data mining cases created for review; frequency with which each
rule is triggered and associated DM case disposition, and
information about the findings, determinations, and corrective
actions identified) and results of the Semi-Annual HA process to
inform its decision making.</p>

Insights on Demand</h2>
      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. Insights on Demand (IOD) is the SmartPay®3
data mining (DM) tool used to monitor purchasing activity and
perform oversight functions. IOD provides the capabilities to
identify high-risk transactions and unusual spending patterns; scan
purchasing activity for misuse, fraud, waste, and abuse; and flag
transactions for review. Instructions on how to navigate and

Systems’ IOD DM capability evaluates each transaction against
a set of tiered business rules to identify high-risk transactions.
Tier 1 rules are mandatory and applicable to all DoD purchase
cards. Tier 2 rules are mandatory rules that can be tailored as
necessary at the local level. DM cases can be system-generated or
manually generated. The system generates a DM case whenever a
business rule is broken. GPC program officials are required to
manually create cases for each finding and disciplinary category
determination they independently identify during their reviews.
Each case is adjudicated to determine if the transaction is to be
classified under one of five disciplinary categories standardized
in compliance with the DPCAP memo “Final Governmentwide
Commercial Purchase Card Disciplinary Category Definitions
Guidance,” January 27, 2020. Disputes are also categorized as
determinations.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Tier 2 Tailoring</strong>. Tier 2
business rules are tailorable to meet the Army’s
organizational needs. Tailoring must be consistent with
requirements in the DoD Charge Card Guidebook. As part of the SAHAR
process, HAs are required to validate that any Tier 2 Tailoring of
DM business rules are implemented appropriately. For more
information, refer to GPC one-pager 3OP034, “Tier 2 Tailoring
in Insights on Demand (IOD)” on the DPCAP GPC website. To
properly manage program risk for these potentially high-risk
transactions, IOD automatically selects a random sample of 1% of
these Tier 2 “auto closed” cases and assigns them for
adjudication (“1% Random Reopen”). The IST reviews Tier
2 Tailoring data sets and trends and considers methodology changes
based on its findings.</p>
      <p class="p">c. <strong class="ph b">Case Assignment and Review Process</strong>.</p>
      <p class="p List2">1) IOD flags a transaction for review, generates a
case, and assigns it to the primary BO.</p>
      <p class="p List2">2) The BO reviews the CH’s file
documentation per section 6-2.g. The BO then locates the case in
IOD and inputs requested data.</p>
      <p class="p List2">3) After the BO submits their review, IOD assigns
the case to the Level 4 A/OPC. The Level 4 A/OPC reviews the
CH’s file documentation, inputs comments about the purchase,
identifies the applicable finding, and closes the case. The
comments should provide information about the transaction and a
detailed explanation of any findings. For administrative findings,
the comments must state what documents or signatures were
missing.</p>

a Monthly A/OPC Review at the end of each billing cycle. To
complete the A/OPC Monthly Review, you must generate the Monthly
A/OPC Review Report to assess the key internal controls. Within 30
days of the cycle end date, A/OPCs must complete the following
actions:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Validate all DM cases (except those in a
deployed or exempt status) are closed.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Generate the Monthly A/OPC Review Report in IOD
and assess the key internal controls included on the report. Key
GPC program controls are calculated and displayed in the Monthly
A/OPC Review Report generated by the DM tool. See the <a class="xref" href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/asda/dpc/ce/pc/docs/smart-pay/Monthly_Report_Guide.pdf" target="_blank">Monthly
A/OPC Review Report Guide</a>, which addresses data sources,
calculation methodologies, and report format.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Perform a summary assessment that includes 100
percent of all transactions not flagged by the DM tool to (1)
ensure awareness of purchasing activity within their hierarchy and
(2) identify purchasing and behavior patterns not otherwise
identified by the DM tool (e.g., patterns that span multiple card
accounts and/or MAs) or that may otherwise require A/OPC action.
Access Online Transaction Detail reports are available for
performing these reviews.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Ensure a DM case is created for each Finding
and Determination they independently identify (i.e., not flagged by
the DM tool).</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) Document completion of the review by completing
and certifying the A/OPC Monthly Checklist. Upload the Monthly
A/OPC Review Report in the Messages tab of the A/OPC Monthly
Review. If a Level 4 A/OPC has multiple agents, they can run one
report for all agents and upload it to the top-listed level.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">OA/OPC Monthly Review</strong>. Level 3
A/OPCs must complete this review once all Level 4 A/OPCs assigned
to them have completed their monthly reviews. The Level 3 A/OPC
reviews the internal controls summary for their program and concurs
with the findings, determinations, and any corrective actions
planned or taken. Level 3 A/OPCs are also required to spot-check
the monthly reviews conducted by their Level 4 A/OPCs. Level 3
A/OPCs will complete monthly reviews within 10 calendar days of
their Level 4 A/OPCs’ completion.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">CPM Monthly Review</strong>. CPMs
(Level 2 A/OPCs) must complete this review once all Level 3 A/OPCs
assigned to them have completed their monthly reviews.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. If the monthly review cannot be completed
(i.e., is deferred) using the DM tool because the BO and/or A/OPC
and their alternates are deployed or exempt and have insufficient
access to the application, the OA/OPC may then mark the case
“Closed – Not Reviewed” in the DM tool and
approve completion of the monthly review cycle. The BO and/or A/OPC
will complete the monthly review manually and then update the audit
tool upon completion of the deployment.</p>

violations, abuse and internal fraud are considered more serious
than the other categories, as they are intentional in nature.
Misuse is considered unintentional. Intent is not applicable to
infrequent delinquencies, as the determination of such violations
is strictly quantitative (i.e., all undisputed account balances
that are unpaid for more than 61 days past the statement date). Figure 11-2 depicts the
decision framework to be used when determining which violation

      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">Fraud can be defined as a deception deliberately practiced with
the motive of securing unfair or unlawful gain. Fraud can be an
attempt to cheat the Federal Government and corrupt its CHs by
using GPC accounts for transactions not part of official Government
business. Fraud can come in many disguises, such as false emails,
mail, or phone calls. The following are the three primary
categories of fraud:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) <strong class="ph b">Non-cardholder Fraud</strong>.
Examples: Lost or stolen card, account takeover, and identity
theft.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) <strong class="ph b">Cardholder Fraud</strong>. Examples:
Kickbacks, falsified transactions, and false statements.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) <strong class="ph b">Merchant Fraud</strong>. Examples:
False transactions, intentional mischarges, bribes, and
gratuities.</p>

      <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title10">
      <span class="ph autonumber">11-9.</span> Non-Cardholder Fraud</h2>
      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. Non-cardholder fraud involves the use of the
card account or CH data by an unauthorized person. Non-cardholder
fraud is investigated by special units within the servicing bank.
Any information acquired relating to non-cardholder fraud should be
reported. The risk of non-cardholder fraud is higher in the
following situations:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) <strong class="ph b">Account/Card never received</strong>. A
new or replacement card has been mailed to the CH but was not
received. This may be due to a third-party interception. In this
case, the account should be cancelled, and new card issued.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) <strong class="ph b">Lost or Stolen Account/Card</strong>.
If the CH reports the account as lost or stolen, the account will
be cancelled and new one issued. Reporting the account as lost or
stolen does not relieve the Federal Government for payment for any
transactions that were made by the account holder prior to losing
it.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) <strong class="ph b">Altered or counterfeit cards</strong>.
This occurs when third parties obtain account information and used
that information to make purchases with an altered or counterfeit
card. If the bank recognizes a fraudulent pattern of use at the
time of authorization, the bank will validate the use of the
account with the CH and/or suspend the account.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) <strong class="ph b">Account takeover/ Identity
theft</strong>. In this case, the account holder’s identity
has been compromised and a third party has requested a new account
by providing confidential information about the account holder. Any
CH who believes that he or she may have been subject to identity
theft should contact the bank’s customer-service department.
Once a determination is made that an account has been compromised,
investigation is the responsibility of the bank. Unless a
government employee is determined to be involved in the fraud, the
agency generally does not participate in the investigation. The
account will be closed, and a replacement account opened.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">If Non-Cardholder Fraud
Occurs</strong>. If fraud is detected on the account, the CH must
immediately report the incident to the following: BO, A/OPC and
servicing bank. The servicing bank will block and/or terminate the
account. If necessary, the bank will then issue a new card with a
new account number. Also, the bank will mail a “Statement of
Fraud” letter to the cardholder, which must be completed and
returned promptly. Sometimes, unauthorized transactions will appear
on the billing statement, even though the account was reported lost
or stolen. Cardholders should report all unauthorized transactions
by calling the bank's customer service telephone number.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Non-Cardholder Fraud Methods</strong>.
Some of the different methods of fraud include the following:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) <strong class="ph b">Counterfeit Accounts</strong>. To make
fake cards, criminals use the newest technology to
“skim” information contained on magnetic stripes of
cards and also to pass security features (such as holograms).</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) <strong class="ph b">Lost or Stolen Accounts</strong>.
Physical cards are stolen from a workplace, gym or unattended
vehicle.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) <strong class="ph b">Card Not Present.</strong> Internet
fraud occurs whenever account information is stolen and used to
make online purchases. Merchant asks for the CVC code (located on
the back of the card) to help prevent this type of fraud.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) <strong class="ph b">Phishing</strong>. Phishing occurs
whenever a CH receives a fake email directing him or her to enter
sensitive personal information on a phony website. The false
website enables the criminal to steal information from the account
holder.</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) <strong class="ph b">Non-Receipt</strong>. This type of
fraud occurs whenever new or replacement cards are mailed and then
stolen while in transit.</p>
        <p class="p List2">6) <strong class="ph b">Identity Theft</strong>. A criminal
applies for an account using another person’s identity and
information.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Detecting Non-Cardholder
Fraud</strong>. One of the first signs that an individual is a
victim of fraud is at least one “mystery expense”
showing up in the monthly statement. To help detect fraud,
cardholders should review their statement by performing the
following actions:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Look for transactions you do not recall
making.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Check for unknown vendors.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Search for account withdrawals you do not
remember making.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Avoiding Non-Cardholder Fraud</strong>.
Cardholders should use the following practices to avoid fraud:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Secure account number and information.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Safeguard your personal identification number
(PIN). Do not write it down; memorize it. Do not share your
PIN.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Monitor your card during transactions. When the
card is returned, check to make sure it is yours.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Immediately report lost or stolen accounts
and/or any questionable charges.</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) Sign the back of a new card as soon as you
receive it. If you do not receive a replacement card before the
expiration date of the older card, contact the bank.</p>
        <p class="p List2">6) Destroy unwanted or expired cards. Shred or
secure monthly statements and receipts.</p>
        <p class="p List2">7) Electronically verify charges appearing on your
monthly statement.</p>
        <p class="p List2">8) Unless you initiated the purchase, never give
your account information over the telephone, through the mail, or
on the internet.</p>
        <p class="p List2">9) Consistently check your account for accuracy of
personal and billing information. Notify the bank if your personal
information and/or address needs updating.</p>
        <p class="p List2">10) Never let a telemarketer or salesperson
pressure you into agreeing to a deal.</p>
        <p class="p List2">11) Be aware of common scams and contact your
A/OPC and the bank for unusual situations.</p>
        <p class="p List2">12) Inform your A/OPC if you won’t be using
your card for an extended time. The A/OPC will temporarily suspend
the card or reduce the single purchase limit to $1.</p>

Fraud</h2>
      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">Cardholder Fraud, Misuse and
Abuse</strong>. This type of fraud occurs when a cardholder uses
their account to transact business that is not sanctioned, not
authorized, not in one’s official Government capacity, not
for the purpose for which the card was issued, and/or not as part
of official Government business. Intentional use of a GPC account
for other than official Government business constitutes abuse, and
depending on the situation, may constitute fraud.</p>
        <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_11-10__Figure_11-2_Violation_Category_Decision">b.
<strong class="ph b">Consequences of Cardholder Fraud</strong>. Cardholders have
a responsibility to use the account to procure supplies and
services at the direction of the Army under official purchase
authorization. If a CH abuses the GPC or participates in fraud, the
Army may cancel the purchase account and take appropriate
disciplinary action against the CH. In the case of account abuse,
any participating employee may be held personally liable to the
Federal Government for the amount of any unauthorized transaction.
Depending on the facts involved, an employee may be subject to fine
or imprisonment for action relating to purchase account abuse and
fraud. There are guidelines and procedures for disciplinary action
to be taken against individuals for the improper, fraudulent, or
abusive use of the purchase account. Purchase account abuse/fraud
may have the following potential consequences:</p>

        <p class="p List2">2) Cancellation of card account</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Notation in employee performance evaluation</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Reprimand</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) Suspension of employment</p>
        <p class="p List2">6) Termination of employment</p>
        <p class="p List2">7) Criminal prosecution</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">If Cardholder Fraud Occurs</strong>. If
an A/OPC suspects that a BO or CH has committed fraud, the A/OPC
should first contact the individual’s command. The A/OPC may
file a complaint with the Army Inspector General. Investigations
are initiated upon receipt of a complaint or other information that
gives a reasonable account of the wrongful or fraudulent act. The
DoD hotline phone number is 800-424-9098 to report fraud. A/OPCs
should be as specific as possible when reporting fraud. The
following information should be provided:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Employee's full name</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Rank or pay grade</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Duty station</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Specific suspected fraudulent act or
wrongdoing</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) Specific dates and times</p>
        <p class="p List2">6) Specific location of where the suspected
fraudulent act occurred</p>
        <p class="p List2">7) How the individual completed the alleged
fraudulent act</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Merchant Fraud</strong>. This type of
fraud is committed by the merchant. Merchant fraud can occur either
with or without the CH’s knowledge or consent. Rotating
sources may help prevent this type of fraud. Billing errors, such
as duplicate charges, are not considered merchant fraud. Examples
include:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) A vendor intentionally charges for items not
delivered/services not performed.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) A vendor offers bribes and gratuities to a
government employee in exchange for gaining purchasing
activity.</p>

      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">Reports for Identifying and Preventing
Fraud</strong>. A/OPCs should use the following reports to identify
potential card misuse and fraud and to prevent fraud from
occurring:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) <strong class="ph b">Declined Transaction Authorizations
Report</strong>. This report identifies cardholders who have
attempted to use an account to buy an item for which they are not
authorized, that exceeds their single purchase limit, that exceeds
their monthly purchase limit, or from a merchant that falls under a
blocked MCC.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) <strong class="ph b">Transaction Detail Report</strong>.
This report identifies the date, merchant, reason code, dollar
amount, and status of each dispute filed by CH. BOs and A/OPCs
should track and follow up on disputes to determine their outcomes.
Cardholders should attempt to resolve disputes directly with
merchants prior to filing a disputes report. If a merchant is
consistently appearing on the disputes report, the A/OPC should
determine whether the merchant may have billing issues, quality
issues, or is attempting to commit fraud by submitting false
transactions.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) <strong class="ph b">Unusual Spending Activity
Report</strong>. This report identifies transactions that may
warrant further review.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) <strong class="ph b">Account Status Change Report.</strong>
This report lists accounts with a change status of lost/stolen,
closed, or reopened accounts. This status may either be an
indicator that the CH needs to secure the account or that the CH is
attempting to disguise misuse or fraudulent activity by denying the
charges.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Reporting Fraud</strong>. All
identified instances of suspected fraud or abuse must be reported.
Various channels of reporting include the Chain of Command, the
A/OPC, the command’s procurement fraud advisor (Staff/Command
Judge Advocate), the servicing Criminal Investigation Division
office, internal review organizations, and Inspector Generals at
all levels. Notify the CH’s commander or second-line
supervisor, as appropriate, and security manager when a Defense
criminal investigative organization or Defense organizational
element responsible for investigating potential misconduct
involving the GPC initiates an investigation into allegations of
charge card violations. Whenever possible, this notification should
take place within 72 hours of the initiation. See DoD Charge Card
Guidebook A.1.11.</p>

          </a> is a helpful
resource when identifying the type of violation.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. A/OPCs should be alert to the following
indicators of possible fraud, waste, or abuse:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Repetitive buys from the same merchant</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Lack of documentation for a purchase</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Failure to safeguard cards and account
numbers</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) CH or BO authorizing the use of their cards by

        <p class="p List2">6) Payments made for items not received</p>
        <p class="p List2">7) Split purchases to avoid spending

        <p class="p List2">9) Payment delinquencies incurring interest
penalties</p>
        <p class="p List2">10) Approval of a CH’s statement of account
by someone other than the CH or BO</p>

        <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Taking Corrective Action</strong>. When
an A/OPC discovers a violation of GPC policies, the A/OPC must take
corrective action. The course of action will vary depending on the
intentionality and severity of the infraction. A/OPCs should take
one or more of the following corrective actions:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Document the purchase violation in IOD and the
purchase file.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Require involved parties to attend
training.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Inform the involved parties’ supervisor
or commander.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Suspend CH or BO account.</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) Terminate CH or BO appointment and account.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Continual or Severe
Violations</strong>. Continual violation of GPC procedures by a CH
or BO will result in termination of GPC privileges. A/OPCs will
document the violation and action taken in their files for that
particular CH/BO. A/OPCs will refer evidence of deliberate abuse to
the CH and/or BO’s supervisor, Commander, or SCO for
appropriate action in accordance with the Uniform Code of Military
Justice or civilian disciplinary rules. A/OPCs will refer evidence
of internal fraud or other criminal activity to the Commander or
SCO.</p>

        <p class="p List1">e. Any misuse of the GPC is subject to criminal,
civil, Uniform Code of Military Justice, administrative, and
disciplinary actions as appropriate. See below Table 11-6 for
details. The Offenses and Penalties table in AR 690-752 is intended
for use as a guide for selecting an appropriate penalty for
infractions committed by civilian employees as it may not
effectively address all situations. This table does not substitute
for independent supervisory judgment and does not dictate
penalties. A supervisor may choose the severity of action ranging
from no penalty, informal disciplinary actions, to the maximum
penalty of removal.</p>
