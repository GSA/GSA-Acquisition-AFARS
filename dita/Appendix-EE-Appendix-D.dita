            procedures; and to identify any GPC misuse, fraud, waste, and abuse. The attached
            checklist below is designed to help reviewers perform the required review. Each activity
            is encouraged to supplement and tailor their review checklist to include any unique
            requirements. It may be necessary to complete one check list for each CH associated with
            the BO account. Place a copy in each CHâ€™s file.</p>

            simulation, and other). Answers that indicate deficiencies must be explained and
            corrective action indicated in supporting documentation. </p>
