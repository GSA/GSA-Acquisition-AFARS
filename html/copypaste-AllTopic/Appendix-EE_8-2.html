      <p class="p">1) Creating a new training course.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Adding terms and conditions to a regularly scheduled, COTS training event.</p>
      <p class="p">3) Taking an existing course and tailoring it to be agency-specific (e.g., mission, regulations, policies, personnel, etc.).</p>
      <p class="p">4) Materials and content are tailored specific to the agency.</p>
      <p class="p">5) Typically requires a detailed Statement of Work (SOW) and review/acceptance of deliverable.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. If the Government has a need for tailored training or tailored training materials, the requirement must be placed on a Government contract by a warranted Contracting Officer. See DoD Charge Card Guidebook A.1.3. The GPC may be used as the payment method but not the procurement method. A CH must <strong class="ph b">never</strong> sign any vendor written terms and conditions that would financially bind the Government without proper authority.</p>
