      <p class="p List1">(b) All members of the acquisition team will participate in market research and apply their functional tools and expertise. Program managers or representatives of the requiring activity will typically lead the market research effort. A statement that the solicitation will be synopsized and that all proposals received will be evaluated is not a substitute for performing adequate market research and in itself does not support and justify procurement under other than full and open conditions. Specific requirements pertaining to market research in support of other than full and open competition are included in AFARS

      <p class="p">Contracting officers are reminded to consider the use of pre-existing contracts to fulfill requirements for supplies or services, before awarding new contracts. Contracting officers should ensure the results of the market research justify the basis for the decision to initiate a new standalone contract when a preexisting contract is available, and that the decision is documented in the written acquisition plan in accordance with FAR 7.10; DFARS 207.1; and AFARS <a class="xref 5107.1 fm:Subpart" href="AFARS_PART_5107.html#AFARS_Subpart_5107.1">subpart&nbsp; 5107.1</a> and the acquisition strategy for services in accordance with <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="AFARS_PART_5137.html#AFARS_5137.5906">5137.590-6 Acquisition strategy content.</a>. </p>

The Services Acquisition 
         Market Research Report Template should be developed using the DAU tool at <a class="xref" href="https://www.dau.edu/tools/t/Services-Acquisition-Market-Research-Report" target="_blank">https://www.dau.edu/tools/t/Services-Acquisition-Market-Research-Report</a>
