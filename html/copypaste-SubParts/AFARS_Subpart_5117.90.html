   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p">A Job Order Contract (JOC) is an indefinite-delivery,
         indefinite-quantity contract and an alternative contracting method to fulfill repair,
         maintenance, and minor construction requirements on a variety of projects ranging from
         sustainment, restoration, and modernization, simplified acquisition of base repair
         requirements, civil works operations and maintenance, small renovations, real property
         repair and maintenance with an estimated value more than the micro-purchase threshold for
         acquisitions of construction. A JOC includes a comprehensive collection of detailed repair,
         maintenance, and minor construction task descriptions or specifications, units of measure,
         and pre-established unit prices for discrete tasks. Each JOC order is comprised of several
         pre-described and pre-priced tasks. In general, proposed projects valued at or below the
         micro-purchase threshold for acquisitions of construction are considered inappropriate for
         ordering under a JOC because of the administrative costs associated with processing JOC
         orders and the simplified purchase methods available for these actions.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p">As used in this subpart –</p>
      <p class="p List1">“JOC Price Book” (JOCPB) means the
         compilation of repair, maintenance, and minor construction tasks, associated units of
         measure and unit prices that are used in job order solicitations and a JOC. JOC unit prices
         include direct material, labor and equipment costs, but not indirect costs or profits which
         are addressed in the coefficient(s). The use of labor-only line items is appropriate for
         use when proper internal controls are in place and incidental to construction. Labor line
         items are not to provide services, typically performed under a separate service or
         requirements contract. The JOCPB reflects the current local costs in detail for
         construction tasks expected to be performed in the geographical area of the base contract
         with the primary use of developing a detailed line item price. For CONUS, the JOCPB shall
         be developed using commercially available pricing tools to ensure consistent and
         comprehensive pricing of tasks unless the <span class="ph Revised October 1, 2024">C</span>ontracting officer determines the use of a
         commercially available pricing tool is not in the best interest of the government. </p>
      <p class="p List1">“Coefficient” means a numerical factor
         that represents costs (generally indirect costs) not included in JOCPB unit prices (e.g.,
         general and administrative and other overhead costs, insurance costs, bonding and
         alternative payment protection costs, protective clothing,</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">(a) To solicit for a JOC, the Government
         must develop task specifications and a JOCPB tailored to the needs of the requiring
         activity to be supported. Any special range pricing (to get quantity discounts) of units
         associated with the requirements of known JOC projects to be ordered must be specified. </p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">(a) The <span class="ph Revised October 1, 2024">C</span>ontracting officer must ensure
         that the specifications and the JOCPB have undergone technical review and validation and
         are tailored to meet the projected requirements of the requiring activity and local
         economic conditions. </p>
      <p class="p List1">(b) The JOC solicitation must include
         realistic and reasonable annual minimum and maximum dollar amounts for projected
         requirements to encourage competition and lower coefficients. Generally, the higher the
         minimum is, the lower the coefficient proposed will be. </p>
      <p class="p List1">(c) The solicitation must explain the
         make-up of the Government unit prices and specify what types of costs, as a minimum, must
         be covered by the coefficient. Offerors may have multiple coefficients and must specify
         what additional types of costs are included in their coefficients in their proposal. These
         additional costs may be incorporated in the contract, if appropriate, and may preclude
         later disagreements over non-pre-priced tasks. Multiple coefficients may be used for normal
         working hours and other than normal working hours.</p>
      <p class="p List1">(d) The solicitation must explain that
         there will be no separate repayment(s) for bond premiums because the bond premium is repaid
         through the coefficient, and the coefficient is paid as an indirect cost under progress
         payment or other standard payment provisions.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">(a) Except as otherwise specified in this
         subpart, orders must be executed in accordance with FAR 16.505(a).</p>
      <p class="p List1">(b) <em class="ph i">Statement of work.</em>
      </p>
      <p class="p List2">(1) The SOW for the proposed order must
         contain sufficient detail to enable the Government to develop an independent government
         estimate (IGE), in accordance with FAR 36.203 and to ensure that the contractor can
         properly prepare a responsive and cost-effective proposal with a minimum of non-pre-priced
         tasks.</p>
      <p class="p List2">(2) The SOW must be updated before issuing
         the order to reflect the negotiated agreement’s details and to include significant
         quantities, methods of construction, quality levels, and the number of days to complete the
         work. </p>
      <p class="p List1">(c) <em class="ph i">Limitations.</em>
      </p>
      <p class="p List2">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2),
         the value of non-pre-priced work under an order must not exceed 10 percent of the value of
         the pre-priced work.</p>
      <p class="p List3">(i) The value of the pre-priced work must
         be computed by multiplying the coefficient(s) times the appropriate unit price(s) in the
         JOCPB.</p>
      <p class="p List3">(ii) When the contract allows, indirect
         costs and profit for non-pre-priced work may be attributed by the application of a
         solicited and pre-agreed rate to be applied to the unburdened labor, equipment, and
         material costs of the non-pre-priced work.</p>
      <p class="p List3">(iii) Description of non-pre-priced work
         must not be manipulated or forced to fit under a pre-priced line item, either to avoid
         including non-pre-priced line items in the order or to reduce the value of non-pre-priced
         line items in an attempt to circumvent the limitation in (c)(2).</p>
      <p class="p List2">(2) Normally, if the value of the
         non-pre-priced work exceeds 10 percent, then the non-pre-priced work should be reduced,
         eliminated, performed in-house, or the job must be acquired using other contracting
         methods. However, <span class="ph Revised October 1, 2024">C</span>ontracting officers may exceed the 10 percent if justified and approved
         in accordance with FAR 6.302. The <span class="ph Revised October 1, 2024">C</span>ontracting officer shall negotiate the modification and
         make a determination that the price is fair and reasonable.</p>
      <p class="p List1">(d) <em class="ph i">Distribution.</em> A copy of all JOC
         orders must be sent to the contracting office appointing ordering officers, the Finance and
         Accounting Office, the office or individual assigned responsibility for inspection and
         technical administration of the contract, and any appointed COR. The <span class="ph Revised October 1, 2024">C</span>ontracting officer
