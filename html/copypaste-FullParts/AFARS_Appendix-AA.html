      <p class="p">The success of any source selection is usually determined by the
personnel involved at all levels, and their degree of active
participation. Likewise, the Source Selection Authority (SSA), with
assistance from the SCO, will ensure the appointment of personnel
with the requisite skills, expertise, and experience to ensure the
success of the source selection, to include members appointed to
the Source Selection Advisory Council (SSAC).</p>
      <p class="p">The SCO is responsible for determining the capability of the
organization to effectively resource the SST as set forth in the
hierarchy of source selection expertise below (See Figure 1-1). In
the event the SCO determines the required expertise is not
obtainable, the HCA will be consulted. If the HCA concurs the
appropriate resources are still unavailable, the DASA(P) will be
notified and will assist in providing resources from other
contracting activities or assign the procurement to another
contracting activity for execution.</p>

        </p>
      <p class="p">The size and composition of the SST will vary depending upon the
requirements of each acquisition. For example, major hardware
acquisitions frequently involve requirements impacting various
organizations from across the Army (or from other services on
joint-service programs). In such cases, and when forming the SST,
SSEB Factor/Subfactor teams should include evaluator representation
from each major requirements organization. These evaluators should
be assigned to the evaluation criteria associated with their
specific area of requirements and expertise. Inclusion of technical
evaluators who are subject matter experts on the requirement(s)
being evaluated is essential to a successful evaluation process
providing fair/accurate assessment of the proposals, and absolutely
critical where joint-service and/or multiple functional
requirements are involved.</p>
      <p class="p">Whether the team is large or small, it should be structured to
ensure teamwork, unity of purpose, and allow for appropriate open
communication among the team members throughout the process. This
will facilitate a comprehensive evaluation and selection of the
best value proposal.</p>

          <strong class="ph b">Selection of Evaluation Factors<em class="ph i">.</em>
          </strong>
Selecting the correct evaluation factors is the most important
decision in the evaluation process. Structure the evaluation
factors and their relative importance to clearly reflect the needs
of your acquisition, with consideration given to the inclusion and
evaluation of intellectual property/data rights and what is
necessary and prudent be included in the acquisition.</p>
      <p class="p">
          <strong class="ph b">Mandatory Evaluation Considerations<em class="ph i">.</em>
          </strong>
For source selections, you must evaluate cost/price (unless the
exception at FAR 15.304(c)(1)(ii)(A) applies) and the
acceptability/quality of the proposed product or service through
one or more non-cost evaluation factors (e.g., past performance,
technical excellence, management capability, and key personnel
qualifications).</p>
      <p class="p">As stated at FAR 15.304(c)(1)(ii)(A)), the PCO may exclude
cost/price as an evaluation factor for a Multiple Award IDIQ effort
issued for the same or similar services if the Government intends
to make award to all "qualifying offerors" and Cost/Price will be
considered as one of the factors for all tasks/delivery orders.</p>
      <p class="p" id="AFARS_Appendix-AA_2_2__Hlt514027624">Additionally, you must evaluate past performance on all
negotiated competitive acquisitions expected to exceed the
thresholds identified in FAR 15.304 and
DFARS 215.304, unless the PCO documents why it would not be
appropriate. There may be other required evaluation factors, such
as small business participation, based upon regulatory and/or
statutory requirements. <em class="ph i">(See FAR 1</em>

        </p>
      <p class="p">From this vantage point, the acquisition team must apply prudent
business judgment to add other evaluation factors, subfactors, and
elements that are important to selecting the most advantageous
proposal(s). The number of factors and subfactors should be kept to
the absolute minimum required to effectively assess the
proposal(s). The use of more factors than needed to conduct the
evaluation can complicate and extend the process, while providing
no additional value and thereby diluting meaningful discriminators.
Limiting factors also serves to reduce the evaluation oversight
span-of-control responsibilities of the SSEB leadership, SSA/SSAC,
PCO, and legal counsel, thereby permitting more focused oversight
on the remaining (and most important) factors/subfactors and
reducing the likelihood of evaluation errors.</p>
      <p class="p">Common evaluation factors are cost/price, technical, past
performance, and small business participation.</p>
      <p class="p">
          <strong class="ph b">NOTE</strong>: Ensure small business participation
remains an independent factor, not subordinate and a subfactor to
any other evaluation factor. Additionally, if appropriate for the
requirement, you may have other evaluation factors and/or may use
one or more levels of subfactors. The standard Army naming
convention for the various levels is: Evaluation Factor, Subfactor,
and Element. <em class="ph i">(See Figure 2-1)</em>

          </strong> The
source selection process for services, including development of the
SSP, is often very complex. Organizations must ensure that the SST
is comprised of qualified personnel with specific knowledge of the
types of services to be acquired.</p>
      <p class="p">The use of Sample Tasks is an effective tool in the evaluation
of services. Sample Tasks can provide insight as to the
offeror’s level of understanding of the work to be performed,
as well as how the technical approach relates to the cost/price
proposed for that Sample Task. (<em class="ph i">See Appendix H for an example
of a Sample Task</em>.)</p>
      <p class="p"> To the maximum extent practicable, sample tasks should
set forth requirements that are contemplated for award,
establishing the expectation that offerors will be held accountable
for the resources and costs they propose.</p>
      <p class="p"> The use of generic or hypothetical sample tasks may
unintentionally create an environment that misleads offerors to
understate resources and costs due to the fact that the sample
tasks will not be awarded. Care must be taken to draft the sample
tasks as closely as possible to the types and scope of services
expected to be acquired from the Performance Work Statement (PWS).
If possible, consider the use of a “live” task, which
would be awarded at time of contract award<em class="ph i">.</em>
        </p>
      <p class="p"> Evaluation criteria should be limited to essential
areas of performance that are measurable during the proposal
evaluation process. This will permit a more focused evaluation of
the offeror’s proposed solution to the sample task.</p>

          </strong> RFP inconsistencies can create ambiguity
and result in less advantageous offers, require RFP amendments,
cause delays in the acquisition, and result in litigation.
Inconsistencies between the descriptions of the government’s
requirements, instructions on how to prepare a proposal, and
information related to the evaluation factors and subfactors are
particularly troublesome and can be a result of various groups of
personnel developing different RFP sections without adequate
coordination and review. Additionally, when one document is
revised, those revisions must also be made to other corresponding
documents.</p>
      <p class="p">It may be beneficial to develop a matrix that correlates the RFP
sections and content to ensure consistency. Figure 2-4 illustrates
how key documents and evaluation standards map to one another,
showing the recommended sequencing for document preparation.
Providing industry with a similar copy of the matrix as a reference
tool and part of the solicitation can aid in proposal preparation.
You may also consider including a column for offerors to complete
in the tracking matrix (as shown in Figure 2-4), denoting where in
their proposal the requirement is addressed. This approach promotes
understanding of the linkage within the solicitation, explains how
all parts of the proposal will be used in the evaluation process,
and enables a crosswalk for both the government and offerors to
ensure all requirements have been addressed.</p>

          <strong class="ph b">Avoid Requesting Too Much Information from the
Offerors<em class="ph i">.</em>
          </strong> Instructions for preparing and
submitting proposals are critical to the acquisition. Always keep
in mind:</p>
      <p class="p"> There must be a direct linkage between solicitation
requirements and objectives, each evaluation factor and subfactor,
and the proposal preparation instructions.</p>
      <p class="p"> Request only the <strong class="ph b">essential information</strong>
needed to evaluate proposals against the evaluation factors and
subfactors.</p>
      <p class="p"> Never ask for information that will not be evaluated.
Instructions that require voluminous information can
unintentionally limit or reduce competition by causing potential
offerors to forego responding to the solicitation in favor of a
less costly business opportunity.</p>
      <p class="p"> Excessively large proposals may increase the time and
costs associated with performing the evaluation. Specific guidance
such as proposal page limitations or page recommendations and
narrative font style and size are encouraged but need to be clearly
defined and tailored to the needs of the acquisition.</p>
      <p class="p"> Focus exclusively on <strong class="ph b">true
discriminators</strong> (discriminators linked to critical
requirements which are based on market research, the assessment of
risk, and that enables the evaluation to discern between various
values in the offeror’s proposal). Failure to do so dilutes
the evaluation and compromises the SSA’s ability to identify
the best value proposal.</p>
      <p class="p"> Use performance-based requirements but remain mindful
that design requirements that are too detailed, or overly
prescriptive performance work statements, severely limits the
offerors’ flexibility to propose their best solutions.
Instead, use functional or performance-based requirements to the
maximum extent practicable. While it may be more difficult to
develop evaluation criteria and conduct the evaluation process
using this approach, the benefits warrant and support it. These
benefits can include increased competition, access to the best
commercial technology, better technical solutions, and fewer
situations for protests.</p>

Equivalent)</u>
          </strong>
        </p>
      <p class="p">
          <strong class="ph b">Provide specific guidance to offerors regarding the
structure of their proposals<em class="ph i">.</em>
          </strong> The proposal should
be divided into distinct volumes or files. These volumes/files
should correlate to each of the evaluation teams (e.g., technical,
cost/price, past performance, etc.) or factors. How each
volume/file is to be structured should be stated. These practices
will facilitate distributing and aligning the proposal material to
the various teams or specific factors, making it easier for
evaluators to locate specific information in the proposals.</p>
      <p class="p">
          <strong class="ph b">NOTE<em class="ph i">:</em>
          </strong> Clearly advise offerors to keep
technical and pricing information separate and not inter-mixed
between proposal volumes.</p>
      <p class="p">
          <strong class="ph b">
            <u class="ph u">Past Performance Information</u>
            <em class="ph i">.</em>
          </strong>
Tailor the proposal submission requirements to reflect the
complexity of the procurement and the relative importance assigned
to past performance. Request only the information necessary for the
evaluation. Consider the following when developing proposal
submission requirements:</p>
      <p class="p"> <strong class="ph b">Contract references<em class="ph i">.</em>
          </strong> Request
offerors to submit a list of government and non-government contract
references to include joint venture participation. References are
to include contract number, contract type and dollar value, place
of performance, date of award, whether performance is on-going or
complete, extent of subcontracting, and the names, phone numbers,
and e-mail addresses of at least two points of contacts for each
contract.</p>
      <p class="p">o Require the list to include all relevant on-going contracts,
or contracts completed during a specified period. This approach
will provide an ‘unfiltered’ view of the
offeror’s contract efforts, not just the ‘select’
contract efforts. If you anticipate the number of contracts will be
excessive, limit the submission to a specified number of the most
recent, relevant contracts. In such cases, require the contracts to
have been active for a specified period of time, since newly
awarded contracts will probably not provide sufficient
information.</p>
      <p class="p">o Recommend limiting the specified period to contracts performed
within the last three years, or no greater than six years for
simple construction, architect-engineering (A-E) contracts, and
more complex works. Recency of past performance should be
calculated using the RFP release date as a benchmark. A shorter
period may be appropriate for acquisitions where there are numerous
actions and/or many vendors providing the required items.</p>
      <p class="p">o When appropriate and determining recency for certain types of
large construction works (e.g., military housing, navigation
projects or other large civil works), a greater time period in
excess of six years should be considered and used to obtain
realistic examples of past performance.</p>
      <p class="p">o When offerors are likely to be large, multi-function firms,
limit the contract references to those performed by the segment of
the firm (e.g., division, group, and unit) that is submitting a
proposal.</p>
      <p class="p"> <strong class="ph b">Past Performance Information of a Prospective
Subcontractor<em class="ph i">.</em>
          </strong> When planning how a
subcontractors’ past performance is intended to be evaluated,
explain how any related adverse past performance information will
be handled. In some acquisitions, an offeror’s prospective
subcontractor may be the offeror’s competitor on other
acquisitions. In such cases, the prospective subcontractor may be
hesitant to have any adverse information related to its past
performance released to the offeror. The acquisition should be
tailored accordingly and advise offerors in the RFP how the
disclosure of such information will be handled.</p>
      <p class="p">
<strong class="ph b">Questionnaires.</strong>Questionnaires
or interviews may be utilized to obtain the information from
individuals having knowledge about the offeror’s past
performance, and details such as contract points of contact (name,
email, and phone numbers) shall be included in the information
provided back to the government in the proposal.</p>
      <p class="p">Consider the following when using questionnaires:</p>
      <p class="p">o Keep the questionnaire short. Typically, it should be no
longer than 1-2 pages.</p>
      <p class="p">o Format the questionnaire to easily facilitate electronic
completion (e.g., fill-in blocks, and electronic checkboxes).</p>
      <p class="p">o Include a copy of the questionnaire in the RFP.</p>
      <p class="p">o Either distribute the questionnaires to the points of contact
or have the offerors distribute the questionnaires. Prior to the
government sending out the questionnaires, and when practical,
contact the respective points of contact and emphasize the
importance of the completed questionnaires returned to the
government promptly. Having the offerors send out the
questionnaires may save time and resources.</p>
      <p class="p"> <strong class="ph b">Small Business Participation Past
Performance</strong>. All offerors shall submit information
substantiating their past performance and compliance with FAR
52.219-8 Utilization of Small Business Concerns, FAR 52.219-9 Small
Business Subcontracting Plan, and DFARS Subpart 215.305 Proposal
Evaluation, to maximize opportunities for small business
subcontractors. Offerors shall also provide a statement indicating
whether any negative information has been reported in the past
three years (or other number of years as identified in the
solicitation) concerning their past compliance with FAR 52.219-8 or
FAR 52.219-9. If any such negative information is reported, the
offeror may submit explanations or comments responding to such
negative information. Offerors with no prior contracts containing
FAR 52.219-8 and/or 52.219-9 shall certify stating as such. For
other than small business, include SF 294 and SF 295 (or Individual
Subcontracting and Summary Subcontracting Reports in eSRS)
information for Government contracts with these reporting
requirements for the last <em class="ph i">X</em> (fill in number, same as
period stated elsewhere for past performance) number of years.</p>
      <p class="p"> <strong class="ph b">Relevant Past Performance<em class="ph i">.</em>
          </strong>
Include in the RFP a definition of what constitutes relevant past
performance. Factors that may be used to define relevancy include
similarity, size, complexity, dollar value, contract type, and
degree of subcontracting/teaming. As appropriate, require the
offeror provide a description of how the contract references are
relevant to the immediate acquisition. In some cases, previous
contracts as a whole may be relevant to the immediate acquisition,
while only portions of other contracts may be relevant.</p>

            <em class="ph i">.</em>
          </strong>
The Army methodology for evaluating small business participation in
<strong class="ph b">unrestricted</strong> source selections is to establish a
separate factor (versus a subfactor under technical) with an
assigned relative order of importance for small business
participation as it relates to the other source selection
evaluation factors as stated at FAR 15.304(c)(3)(ii) and
(c)(4).</p>
      <p class="p">When evaluating small business participation, solicitations must
be structured to give offers submitted by small business concerns
the highest rating for this evaluation factor in accordance with
FAR 15.305(a)(5). In addition, small businesses are not required to
submit any information (see C.F.R.125.3(g)(3)) in connection with
the small business participation evaluation factor or required to
submit a proposed Small Business Participation Commitment
Document.</p>
      <p class="p">
          <strong class="ph b"> Proposal Submission Instructions</strong>. The
submission instructions should be written clearly enough to
indicate that:</p>
      <p class="p">o Other than small business contractors may achieve the small
business participation goals through subcontracting to small
businesses.</p>
      <p class="p">o Small business contractors may achieve small business
participation goals through their own performance/participation as
a prime and also through a joint venture, teaming arrangement,
and/or subcontracting to other small businesses.</p>
      <p class="p"> <strong class="ph b">Small Business Participation Commitment
Document (SBPCD).</strong> The SBPCD format is designed to
streamline and bring uniformity to responses and evaluations for
small business participation when required under FAR 15.304. The
format provides clarity that is distinctly different from the Small
Business Subcontracting Plan required for other than small
businesses. <em class="ph i">(See FAR 52.219-9)</em>
        </p>
      <p class="p">A sample SBPCD format is located at Appendix F and can be

RFP. <strong class="ph b">NOTE:</strong> The SBPCD is to be rated
acceptable/unacceptable. <em class="ph i">(Ref DoD Source Selection Procedures

          </strong> Separate
from the SBPCD, other than small business offerors must also submit
a small business subcontracting plan meeting the requirements of
FAR 52.219-9 and DFARS 252.219-7003 (or DFARS 252.219-7004 if the
offeror has a comprehensive subcontracting plan).</p>
      <p class="p">o Other than small businesses must submit acceptable

          </strong> Instead of evaluating
management as a separate evaluation factor, consider assessing
management effectiveness in meeting Technical and Schedule
requirements as part of the past performance evaluation. Using past
performance in this way may, under appropriate circumstances,
eliminate the need for the offeror to submit management and quality
plans.</p>
      <p class="p"> <strong class="ph b">Past Performance
Considerations<em class="ph i">.</em>
          </strong> At a minimum, consider the
offeror’s record of complying with contractual requirements
in the areas of schedule, technical quality, and cost control (for

Other than small businesses will be evaluated on their level of
proposed small business participation in the performance of a
resulting contract relative to the objectives established herein.
Offerors shall submit a SBPCD which specifies the offeror’s
level and degree of commitment to small business
utilization/participation in performance of this requirement. A
SBPCD is required from all offerors, including companies with
commercial plans and comprehensive subcontracting plans.</p>
      <p class="p">Small businesses are not required to submit subcontracting plans
but will be required to address the extent of small business
performance (participation) in their proposals when required by the
solicitation.</p>
      <p class="p">The government may evaluate:</p>
      <p class="p"> The extent to which such firms, as defined in FAR Part
19, are specifically identified in proposals;</p>
      <p class="p"> The extent of commitment to use such firms (and
enforceable commitments will be considered more favorably than
non-enforceable ones);</p>
      <p class="p"> Identification of the complexity and variety of the
work small firms are to perform;</p>
      <p class="p"> The realism of the proposal; and</p>
      <p class="p"> Past performance of the offerors in complying with
requirements of the clauses at FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small
Business Concerns, and 52.219-9 Small Business Subcontracting
Plan.</p>
      <p class="p"> Small business participation goals/Minimum Quantitative
Requirement (MRQ) is based on market research (e.g., inclusive of
researching historical data and contacting subject matter experts).
Research can entail the type and complexity of work, the
availability of small businesses, and their capability and
capacity.</p>
      <p class="p"> If using the percentage of subcontracted dollars for
the SBPCD, the dollars should correlate directly to the percentage
of subcontracted dollars in the small business subcontracting plan
for other than small businesses. <strong class="ph b">NOTE:</strong> DoD’s
assigned subcontracting goals may be used to establish small
business participation minimum goals when market research results
confirms that these goals are achievable or when market research is
lacking sufficient data to use another source as a baseline.</p>
      <p class="p"> Small business prime offerors shall be advised that
their own participation as a prime can be counted towards the
percentages set in this evaluation factor. Small businesses shall
not be required to subcontract to other small businesses in order
to achieve the small business participation goals, unless small
business goals are set as a percentage of planned subcontracting
dollars.</p>
      <p class="p"> Requiring offerors to provide both the percentage and
the associated total dollar equivalent of work to be performed by
small businesses can assist in providing consistency in the
evaluation. Additionally, the information may be helpful to provide
transparency for small businesses when previously performed
services are currently consolidated and/or bundled into an
unrestricted acquisition.</p>

          <strong class="ph b">NOTE<em class="ph i">:</em>
          </strong> Dollars awarded to a firm with

Since each offeror in the scenario below is allowed to determine
how much of the work is planned for subcontracting, including small

planned subcontracting dollars methodology can provide a skewed
evaluation of small business participation if not analyzed
thoroughly. Percentage of planned subcontracted dollars can reflect
a high percentage with low dollars going to small businesses (e.g.,
Other than Small Business Offeror B below), and vice versa with a
lower percentage but higher dollars (e.g., Other than Small
Business Offeror A below) going to small business, as shown in the
scenario below.</p>

to make an informed and reasoned selection.</em>
          </strong> To this
end result, the evaluators will identify strengths, weaknesses,
deficiencies, risks, and uncertainties applicable to each proposal.
The process of identifying these findings is crucial to the
competitive range determination, the conduct of meaningful
discussions and debriefings, and the tradeoff analysis described in
the Source Selection Decision Document (SSDD).</p>

      <p class="p">While the below steps are identified in a linear manner, some of
the process is iterative and some steps may be accomplished
concurrently. Except where noted, these steps apply to the
evaluation of both the cost and non-cost factors. The groups

      <p class="p">
          <strong class="ph b">Step 1: Conduct SSEB Training <em class="ph i">–</em>
          </strong>
Prior to receipt of proposals, each evaluator must become familiar
with all pertinent documents (e.g., the RFP and SSP). Source
selection evaluation training shall be provided/required for each
evaluation and conducted by the PCO, at the PCO’s request,
and under their supervision; the evaluation training may be
conducted by another qualified source selection expert or an agency
team. Training shall include an overview of the source selection
process, required documents, and include a detailed focus on how to
properly document rationale for the assigned rating, as well as the
assessment of each offeror’s proposal’s strengths,
weaknesses, uncertainties, risks, and deficiencies. Designated
Legal Counsel is recommended to assist in the source selection
evaluation training as well, providing content relating to ethics,
procurement integrity, the protection of source selection
information, and signing of non-disclosure agreements.</p>
      <p class="p">The training will be based on the contents of the DoD Source
Selection Procedures and this supplement. Defense Acquisition
University (DAU) training may be useful and can be required for
SSEB members at the PCO or SSA’s discretion. Ensuring all
SSEB members have current, and a standardized level of training is
a priority and is especially crucial when evaluators have no
previous or varying levels of prior source selection evaluation
experience, as is frequently the case. Specific organization or
requirement information should be included as part of the initial
SSEB training.</p>
      <p class="p">
          <strong class="ph b">Step 2: Perform Initial Screening of Proposals
<em class="ph i">–</em>
          </strong> Upon receipt of proposals, the PCO or
designee shall conduct an initial screening to ensure
offerors’ proposals comply with the RFP instructions for
submission of all required information, including electronic media,
in the quantities and format specified in the RFP. The screening of
prime and major subcontractor names to ensure no conflict of
interest for the SST is strongly recommended, especially if
contract advisors are used as part of the evaluation team. Figure
3-1 is an extract of a sample proposal screening checklist that may
be used to accomplish this initial screening and should be tailored
to match the specific proposal submission requirements of the
RFP.</p>

Analysis</em>
        </p>
      <p class="p">The following are some general evaluation guidelines and
recommendations for evaluating cost/price:</p>
      <p class="p"> The Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGE) may play
a key role in cost/price analysis. It serves as a benchmark for
price analysis and in cost realism and may also serve as a
benchmark for individual cost elements. The IGE must contain a
rationale of how it was developed (e.g., what estimating tools were
used and what assumptions were made) in order to properly evaluate
cost/price.</p>
      <p class="p"> With the approval of the SSEB Chairperson and the PCO,
the cost/price evaluators should coordinate with the non-cost
factor evaluation team leads, as necessary, to ensure consistency
between the proposed costs/prices and other portions of the
proposal. This interchange between SSEB factor teams is part of the
initial validation exercise and should be continued throughout the
evaluation process to ensure that interrelationships are promptly
identified, and the evaluation findings reflect their recognition.
For example, the technical evaluation may reveal areas where each
offeror’s approach is inadequate or its resourcing
unrealistic, given the proposed approach. The technical evaluators
and the cost evaluators should crosswalk technical deficiencies and
weaknesses and their impact on cost to ensure an adequate
understanding of risks and to ensure proper cost realism
adjustments can be made to the proposed costs, if applicable.</p>
      <p class="p"> When conducting price analysis, consider not only the
total price, including options, but also the prices for the
individual Contract Line Items to ensure they are not unbalanced.
Unbalanced pricing exists when the price of one or more contract
line items is significantly over or understated as indicated by the
application of cost/price analysis techniques. The PCO, with
concurrence of the SSA, if permitted by the RFP may reject the
offer if they determine that this poses an unacceptable risk to the
government. For more information on unbalanced pricing, see FAR
15.404-1(g).</p>
      <p class="p"> For fixed-price contracts, the evaluation can be as
simple as consideration of adequate price competition/comparison of
proposed prices received in response to the solicitation and
ensuring prices are fair and reasonable.</p>
      <p class="p"> Pricing from proposals with marginal or unacceptable
technical ratings should only be included in comparison of proposed
prices after determining that the offeror included all necessary
requirements in the proposed price (for example, a proposal with a
significant weakness or deficiency based on a missing item,
process, or labor category in the technical proposal is likely to
have omitted the same in the proposed price). If only one proposal
is determined to be technically acceptable, adequate price
competition should not be used as the sole basis for determining
price reasonableness.</p>
      <p class="p"> For cost-reimbursement contracts, you must analyze the
offerors’ estimated costs for both realism and
reasonableness. In a competitive environment, the cost realism
analysis enables you to determine each offeror’s probable
cost of performance. This precludes an award decision based on an
overly optimistic cost estimate.</p>

          <strong class="ph b">Sources of Past Performance
Information<em class="ph i">.</em>
          </strong> Where possible, use past performance
information available from government-wide and agency-wide
databases. Use of such information will help to expedite and
streamline the evaluation process.</p>
      <p class="p"> If possible, contact two points of contact on each
contract effort selected for in-depth review. The PCOs, SBPs, CORs,
Fee Determining Officials, and program management office
representatives are often excellent sources of information.</p>
      <p class="p"> If multiple points of contact are providing past
performance information on contract (for example, the PCO, SBP, and
PM), arrange for submission of consolidated input from these
sources. This may remove the need for the evaluation team to
reconcile variances in past performance information submitted.</p>
      <p class="p"> In assessing the feedback, pay particular attention to
the source of that feedback and their familiarity with the
requirements of the contract being assessed. For example, end users
may be unfamiliar with the contract requirements or certain issues
and resolution arising from contract performance may not be
apparent to them.</p>
      <p class="p"> The agency has an obligation to consider information
that has a bearing on an offeror’s past performance if the
SST is aware of (or should have been aware of) the information. For
example, an agency may not ignore contract performance by an
offeror involving the same agency, the same services, and/or the
same PCO, simply because an agency official fails to complete the
necessary assessments or documentation. Consult legal counsel on
how to address this type of information.</p>

          <strong class="ph b">Addressing Adverse Past Performance
Information<em class="ph i">.</em>
          </strong> When adverse past performance is
obtained, as appropriate, contact the respective point of contact
for that contract to obtain further information about the
circumstances surrounding the situation. Additionally, and when
practical, contact at least one other individual to get a second
perspective on the offeror’s performance on the subject
acquisition. Consider the context of the performance problems, any
mitigating circumstances, the number and severity of the problems,
the demonstrated effectiveness of corrective actions taken, and the
overall work record.</p>
      <p class="p" id="AFARS_Appendix-AA_3_1__Toc178607311">If there is
past performance information that adversely impacts an
offeror’s proposal assessment, provide the offeror an
opportunity to address any such information on which it has not had
a previous opportunity to comment. This opportunity may occur
during clarifications, communications, or discussions, depending
upon whether discussions are anticipated.</p>
      <p class="p" id="AFARS_Appendix-AA_3_1__Toc178607312">When
addressing adverse past performance information, identify the
contract, but do not identify the name of the individual who
provided the information. Summarize the problem(s) with sufficient
detail to give the offeror a reasonable opportunity to respond.</p>
      <p class="p">
          <strong class="ph b">NOTE:</strong> Past performance is considered a
responsibility-type determination for purposes of SBA’s
Certificate of Competency (COC) program, even if the next
acceptable offer is also from a small business (<em class="ph i">See FAR
19.601</em>). FAR 19.602-1(a) requires agencies to refer a finding
of non-responsibility to the SBA if the determination would
preclude award. Therefore, if the PCO refuses to consider a small
business concern for award after evaluating the concern's past
performance as a non-trade-off evaluation factor (e.g., a
pass/fail, go/no-go, or acceptable/unacceptable), the matter must
be referred to the SBA. Alternatively, when past performance will
be an evaluation factor in the trade-off process, SBA referral is
not required because the evaluation of past performance is part of
a comparative, best value evaluation and not a responsibility
determination.</p>

      <p class="p">
          <strong class="ph b">The Army methodology for rating the small business
participation factor is to utilize the DoD Source Selection
Procedures rating scheme for Small Business Participation</strong>
          <em class="ph i">(See DoD Source Selection Procedures 3.1.4.1.2 – Table
6).</em> Solely relying on acceptable/unacceptable or pass/fail
rating schemes are the least preferred method of evaluating small
business participation in best value tradeoff source selections.
This rating scheme does not allow evaluators to give higher ratings
to offerors that significantly exceed the stated small business
goals or submit proof of binding agreements with small businesses
and therefore are discouraged.</p>
      <p class="p">Additionally, small business past performance should be
considered and is required in some cases (See FAR
15.304(c)(3)(ii)). In looking at small business past performance,
the government evaluates how well the offeror has performed in
achieving its small business goals. Remember that this should only
be evaluated for other than small businesses in assessing their
compliance with FAR 52.219-9. A tool regularly used by the
government is the electronic Subcontracting Reporting System
(eSRS).</p>
      <p class="p">
          <strong class="ph b">NOTE<em class="ph i">:</em>
          </strong> DFARS PGI 215.304 provides an
example that indicates evaluation of past performance compliance
within a separate small business participation factor. This may
instead be evaluated under the past performance factor,
<strong class="ph b">
            <em class="ph i">but not in both factors</em>
          </strong>.</p>
      <p class="p">Small business offerors (other than firms utilizing the HUBZone
price preference) proposing on unrestricted requirements are not
held to the requirements of FAR 52.219-14 Limitations on
Subcontracting because the clause is applicable to small business
set-aside procurements <u class="ph u">only</u>. However, small business
offerors should meet the small business participation factor goals
through any, or a combination of the following: performance as a
prime small business, performance as a joint venture, or small
business subcontracting.</p>
      <p class="p">DoD Source Selection Procedures 3.1.6 require the offeror to
include a commitment signed by both the offeror and the
subcontractor certifying that, if a contract is awarded resulting
from the proposal, the parties commit to joint performance as
proposed when subcontractor experience is submitted for
consideration as part of the proposal. If the signed commitment is
not fully executed by both parties and provided with the Past
Performance Proposal, subcontractor references will not be
evaluated or considered.</p>

documented. Considerations for further restricting competition may
include expected dollar value of the award, complexity of the

agency’s framing of a discussion question may not

government’s requirements.</p>

Integrating Proposal into the Contract</h3>
      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">When planning the acquisition/source selection, coordinate
closely with legal counsel to select the best method to incorporate
beneficial aspects, such as the small business participation
commitment document or above-threshold performance, into the award
document. This is vital when aspects of a proposal are cited or
emphasized in the SSDD because they were identified as beneficial
to the government, especially when the aspects of the proposal
support a price premium paid by the government. The following
methods may be considered:</p>
        <p class="p">
          <strong class="ph b">Use of Attachment<em class="ph i">.</em>
          </strong>  Beneficial
aspects can be captured in a separate document attached to the
PWS/Statement of Work (SOW)/SOO which clearly defines the changes
to requirements based on specific beneficial aspects but leaves the
original PWS/SOW/SOO untouched. </p>
        <p class="p">
          <strong class="ph b">Section C PWS/ SOW/ SOO, System Specifications, Section
H – Special Contract Requirements, or
Other<em class="ph i">.</em>
          </strong> Above-threshold performance may be
captured within the PWS/SOW/SOO, System Specifications, Section H -
Special Contract Requirements, or otherwise captured in the
contract document, depending upon what is proposed. If using this
method, care must be executed not to permanently increase the
government’s requirements in future RFPs unless it is an
intentional decision on the part of the organization to do
so. </p>
        <p class="p"> <strong class="ph b">
            <em class="ph i">Best Practice:</em>
          </strong>
          <em class="ph i">Methods
other than an addendum to the PWS/SOW/SOO addendum may be preferred
due to the possibility of inadvertent inclusion in subsequent
contracts (causing requirements creep). The intent is not to
increase the government’s minimum requirements, but to hold a
particular offeror to their proposal. (The government may
later determine that the minimum requirement should include the
higher performance and include it at time of re-compete).</em>
        </p>
        <p class="p">
          <strong class="ph b">Model Contract Process.</strong> The RFP should
discuss the model contract process (if used) in Section L (or
equivalent) to ensure that offerors know that they will be
contractually bound to their proposed above-threshold performance.
Include language in the RFP describing how the government will
capture the promised above-threshold performance prior to award.
Above-threshold performance and significant strengths the
government expects to capture in the contract should be addressed
with the offerors during the discussions process.</p>
        <p class="p">When used, model contracts are typically sent to offerors prior
to closing discussions and submission of Final Proposal Revisions
(FPRs) to include the above-threshold performance that will be
captured upon contract award, thereby ensuring that all parties are
aware of what is expected of the prospective awardee. Ensure that
each offeror’s proposed above-threshold performance is
carefully and correctly incorporated into each model contract and
the final narrative is consistent with the letter to the offeror
requesting the FPR.</p>
        <p class="p">
          <strong class="ph b">Incorporation of Portions of Offeror’s Technical
Proposal by Reference. </strong>The RFP should advise
offerors that any part of their proposal can be incorporated by
reference. Only incorporate those portions of an offeror’s
technical proposal that provide benefit to the government.</p>

all the information provided in a postaward debriefing.</p>
          <p class="p">(2) In the event either the government or offeror delays the
debriefing, the PCO must provide the debriefing within the
timeframe established for postaward debriefings.</p>
          <p class="p">(3) If an offeror submits an untimely request for debriefing,
the PCO may nonetheless conduct a debriefing if feasible. In such
case, inform the offeror the request is untimely.
<strong class="ph b">NOTE:</strong> If new information is provided during an
untimely debriefing, it may form the basis of a timely protest.
Therefore, obtain legal advice prior to providing an untimely
debriefing</p>
          <p class="p">(4) Do not count the day the offeror received the notice; start
with the next day. Consider sending the notice by mail with return
receipt requested or by electronic means (facsimile transmission or
e-mail) with immediate acknowledgment requested so that you can
easily establish the date the offeror received it.</p>
          <p class="p">(5) Includes such things as trade secrets; privileged or
confidential information, e.g., manufacturing processes and
techniques, commercial and financial information, and cost data;
and the names of individuals providing past performance
information. It does not include information otherwise available
without restriction to the government or public.</p>
          <p class="p">(6) If the element was significant enough to eliminate the
offeror from the competitive range, it is significant for
debriefing purposes. Include both positive and negative aspects of
the offeror’s proposal to help improve future proposals.</p>

part of the subjective tradeoff source selection process, the DoD
Source Selection Procedures allows for the use of entry-gate
criteria. This is considered a combination approach utilizing
concepts from both LPTA and Subjective Tradeoff. When determining
your evaluation criteria, the PM and the PCO should closely examine
the key requirements and carefully consider whether some objective
elements (i.e., entry-gate criteria) could be evaluated using an
acceptable/unacceptable or pass/fail rating methodology. During the
evaluation of proposals, offerors must be determined to be
acceptable or pass the entry-gate criteria in order to advance in
the subjective tradeoff evaluation. When the requirement can be
clearly stated with a corresponding standard of proof, using this
combination approach with entry-gate criteria can simplify and
streamline the evaluation process. See also Appendix C for more
information on acceptable/ unacceptable criteria.</p>

            <em class="ph i">Example:</em> The Army is buying a large equipment trailer
(LET) using VATEP, and one of the requirements is maximum payload.
The threshold is 80,000 lbs., and the objective is 85,000. As
stated in the RFP, During Step 2 of the VATEP process the SST will
adjust each offeror’s total proposed price (TPP) to derive
the total evaluated price (TEP) by $1,000 for each 50 lbs. of
increased payload over the threshold, for a maximum adjustment to
the TEP of $100,000. This adjustment is for evaluation purposes
only, and will not change the proposed pricing, which will become
the awarded price. If an offeror proposes the threshold for
payload, then they will receive no adjustment.</p>
          <p class="p">In this example, four proposals are received:</p>
          <p class="p"> Offeror A: TPP=$1,050,000; at least an
“acceptable” rating for all minimum requirements,
proposes a maximum payload of 83,500 lbs., an increase of 3,500
lbs. over the threshold.</p>
          <p class="p"> Offeror B: TPP=$1,000,000; at least an
“acceptable” rating for all minimum requirements,
proposes the threshold maximum payload of 80,000 lbs.</p>
          <p class="p"> Offeror C: TPP=$1,150,000; at least an
“acceptable” rating for all minimum requirements,
proposes a maximum payload at the objective level of 85,000 lbs.,
an increase of 5,000 lbs. over the threshold</p>
          <p class="p"> Offeror D: TPP=$950,000; “unacceptable” for
two minimum requirements, proposes a maximum payload at the
objective level of 85,000 lbs., an increase of 5,000 lbs. over the
threshold. <em class="ph i">Offeror D is eliminated in Step 1.</em>
          </p>
          <p class="p">At the conclusion of Step 1, offeror B has the lowest TPP, with
offeror A as the second-lowest cost/price and Offeror C as the
highest price. However, offerors A and C have their TPPs adjusted
since they have proposed maximum payloads above the threshold,
while offeror B has no adjustment since they have proposed only the
threshold maximum payload. The TEP adjustments are as follows:</p>
          <p class="p"> Offeror A has proposed an increase of 3,500 lbs., which
leads to a decrease of their TPP by $70,000, for a TEP of
$980,000.</p>
          <p class="p"> Offeror B has proposed the threshold and receives no
adjustment to their TPP. Therefore, their TEP is $1,000,000.</p>
          <p class="p"> Offeror C has a proposed increase of 5,000 lbs., which
leads to a decrease of their TPP by the maximum amount of $100,000,
for a TEP of $1,050,000.</p>

            <strong class="ph b">Introduction</strong>
          </p>
      <p class="p">Oral presentations, as presented at FAR Part 15.102, provides
offerors an opportunity to substitute or augment written
information and can be conducted in person, via video
teleconferencing, or a mix of the two. Pre-recorded videotaped
presentations do not constitute an oral presentation since it does
not represent a real-time exchange of information, however,
recordings may be included in offeror submissions when
appropriate.</p>
      <p class="p">Oral presentations can be beneficial in a variety of
acquisitions and are most useful when the requirements are clear,
complete, and are stated in performance or functional terms. Oral
presentations may be ideal for gathering information related to how
well offerors understand, will approach, and qualifications
offerors are to perform required work.</p>
      <p class="p">
            <strong class="ph b">Scope of the Oral Presentation</strong>
          </p>
      <p class="p">Before deciding if oral presentations will be allowed for a
given acquisition, the PCO or SSA must first consider and determine
if applicable state or country privacy laws will impact and or
restrict recordings of presenters/presentations. If oral
presentations are deemed acceptable, the PCO or SSA then decides if
the information needed to be evaluated and if factors and subfactor
criteria is best presented orally, in writing, or through a
combination of both means.</p>
      <p class="p">Oral presentations cannot be incorporated into the contract by
reference, so any information to be made part of the contract needs
to be submitted in writing. At a minimum, the offeror must submit
certifications, representations, and a signed offer sheet
(including any exceptions to the government’s terms and
conditions) in writing. Additionally, as a rule of thumb, the
offeror must submit other hard data ("facts"), such as pricing or
costing data and contractual commitments, as part of the written
proposal.</p>
      <p class="p List1">Oral presentations can convey information in such
diverse areas as responses to sample tasks, understanding the
requirements, experience, and relevancy of past performance.</p>
      <p class="p"> 
         <img class="image" src="Graphics/imageD-5_1.jpeg">
      </p>
      <p class="p">Require offerors to submit their briefing materials in advance
of the presentations. This will allow government attendees an
opportunity to review the materials and prepare any associated
questions.</p>
      <p class="p">
            <strong class="ph b">Request for Proposal Information</strong>
          </p>
      <p class="p">If oral presentations are appropriate, all offerors must be
notified in the RFP that the government will use oral presentations
to evaluate and select the contractor. The proposal preparation
instructions must contain explicit instructions and guidance
regarding the extent and nature of the process that will be used.
Elaborate presentations should be discouraged since they may
detract from the information being presented. At a minimum, include
the following information in the RFP:</p>
      <p class="p"> The types of information the offeror must address
during the oral presentations and how it relates to the evaluation
criteria,</p>
      <p class="p"> The required format and content of the presentation
charts and any supporting documentation,</p>
      <p class="p"> Any restrictions on the number of charts, the number of
bullets per chart, and how material/ documentation will be handled
that does not comply with the restrictions,</p>
      <p class="p"> The required submission date for presentation charts
and/or materials,</p>
      <p class="p"> The approximate timeframe when the oral presentations
will be conducted and how the order of the offerors’
presentations will be determined,</p>
      <p class="p"> Whether any rescheduling will be permitted if an
offeror requests a change after the schedule has been
established,</p>
      <p class="p"> The total amount of time each offeror will have to
conduct their oral presentation,</p>
      <p class="p"> Who will make the presentation and a requirement that
the offeror provide a list of names and position titles of
presenters,</p>
      <p class="p"> Whether presentations will be by video, or audio
taped,</p>
      <p class="p"> The location and a description of the presentation site
and resources available to offerors,</p>
      <p class="p"> Any rules and/or prohibitions regarding equipment and
media,</p>
      <p class="p"> How will documents or information referenced in the
presentation material but never presented orally be treated,</p>
      <p class="p"> Any limitations on Government-Offeror interactions
during and or after presentations,</p>
      <p class="p"> Whether presentations will constitute discussions
(S<em class="ph i">ee Fi</em>
            <span class="ph" id="AFARS_Appendix-AA_d-5__Hlt507979103"></span>

            <em class="ph i">re 3-3</em>),</p>
      <p class="p"> Whether use of information provided during oral
presentations is solely for source selection purposes, or whether
information will become part of the contract (which will in turn
require a subsequent written submission of that information),
and</p>
      <p class="p"> Whether offerors should include any cost/price data in
their presentations.</p>
      <p class="p">
            <strong class="ph b">Timing and Sequencing</strong>
          </p>
      <p class="p" id="AFARS_Appendix-AA_d-5__Hlt498144211">Oral presentations can be conducted either before or after
establishing the competitive range.
When oral presentations are the only means of proposal submission,
they must be presented by all offerors. If oral presentations are
conducted prior to establishing the competitive range, care must be
taken to ensure the presentations do not result in discussions.</p>
      <p class="p">Since preparing and presenting oral presentations involves time
and expense, thought should be given regarding requiring offerors
who are not likely to be serious candidates for award having to
conduct oral presentations. This can be an important consideration
with some small businesses. When this is or will likely be a
concern, it is recommended to establish the competitive range prior
to oral presentations and clearly articulate the methodology and
order of process in the RFP.</p>
      <p class="p">The PCO will often draw lots to determine sequence of the
offerors’ presentations. The time between the first and the
last presentations should be as short as possible to minimize any
perceived or actual advantages to the offerors that present later
in the sequence.</p>
      <p class="p">
            <strong class="ph b">Time Limits</strong>
          </p>
      <p class="p">Establish a total time limit for each offeror’s
presentation. It is not advisable to limit the time for individual
topics or sections within the presentation as this detail is at the
discretion of and is the presenter’s responsibility to
decide. If planning a question-and-answer session, it is excluded
from the allotted time for presentations and a separate time limit
it is established.</p>
      <p class="p">There is no ideal amount of time to be allotted for
presentations and or question-and-answer sessions. The decision of
how much time to allocate is determined based on prudent business
judgment supported by the complexity of the acquisition and the
PCO’s or others’ experience and lessons learned.</p>
      <p class="p">
            <strong class="ph b">Facility</strong>
          </p>
      <p class="p">Ideally presentations will be conducted in a facility and
environment that can be controlled. This helps guard against
interruptions, distractions, and helps to ensure a more level
playing field for all offerors and presenters. Nothing precludes
oral presentations being conducted at offeror's facilities. This
may be more efficient if site visits, or other demonstrations are
part of the source selection process.</p>
      <p class="p List1">If using a government-controlled facility it
should be made available for a pre-inspection, and if warranted a
brief run-through of the agenda and order of events. Allowing
offerors to get acquainted with the facility can help to minimize
distractions during the presentation of content.</p>
      <p class="p">
            <strong class="ph b">Recording the Presentations</strong>
          </p>
      <p class="p">Having an exact record of the presentation can prove useful
during the evaluation process, and in the event of a protest or
litigation. Oral presentations can be recorded using a variety of
media, e.g., videotapes, audio tapes, written transcripts, or a
copy of the offeror’s briefing slides or presentation notes.
The SSA is responsible for determining the method and level of
detail of the record.</p>

            <strong class="ph b">
              <em class="ph i">Recording the presentation by some
appropriate means is not only required by FAR 15.1029(e), but it
also makes good business sense.</em>
            </strong>
          </p>
      <p class="p">If using videotaping, allow for the natural behavior of the
presenters. If slides or view graphs are used, the camera should
view both the podium and screen at the same time. Microphones shall
be placed so that all communications can be recorded clearly and at
adequate volume. Every effort should be made to avoid letting the
recording become the focus of the presentation.</p>
      <p class="p">The recording, which is considered source selection information,
will become part of the official record. A copy of the recording
shall be provided to the offeror, with the master copy sealed and
securely stored by the government to ensure there are no
allegations of tampering in the event of a protest or court
action.</p>
      <p class="p">
            <strong class="ph b">Government Attendance</strong>
          </p>
      <p class="p">The PCO should chair every presentation. All of the government
personnel involved in evaluating the presentations should attend
every presentation.</p>
      <p class="p">
            <strong class="ph b">Presenters</strong>
          </p>
      <p class="p">The offeror’s key personnel who will perform or personally
direct the work being described should conduct their relevant
portions of the presentations. Key personnel include project
managers, task leaders, and other in-house staff of the offerors,
or their prospective key subcontractors’ organizations. This
will avoid the oral presentation becoming the domain of a
professional presenter, which would increase costs, detract from
the advantages of oral presentations, and adversely affect small
businesses.</p>
      <p class="p">
            <strong class="ph b">Reviewing the Ground Rules</strong>
          </p>
      <p class="p">Prior to each presentation, the PCO shall review the ground
rules with the attendees. This includes discussing any restrictions
on Government-Offeror information exchanges, information disclosure
rules, documentation requirements, and housekeeping items. These
ground rules should also be included in the RFP.</p>
      <p class="p">If using a quiz as part of your evaluation, the PCO needs to
discuss the related ground rules. For example, can the offeror
caucus or contact outside sources by cell phone before
answering?</p>
      <p class="p" id="AFARS_Appendix-AA_d-5__Hlt498145303">Too much control and regulation should be avoided since it will
inhibit the exchange of information. However, if intent is to avoid
discussions, the PCO should control all exchanges during the
presentations. If conducting oral presentations after opening
discussions, compliance with FAR 15.306 and 15.307 is
required.</p>
      <p class="p List1">
            <strong class="ph b">Evaluation of Presentations</strong>
          </p>
      <p class="p">Evaluations should be performed immediately after each
presentation. Using preprinted evaluation forms will help the
evaluators collect their thoughts and impressions. Remember, even
if preprinted forms are used, evaluators have to provide the
rationale for their conclusions.</p>

          <div class="body conbody">
            <p class="p">The purpose of Appendix E is to provide acquisition
professionals with guidance and/or best practices for conducting
market research, developing solicitations, evaluating proposals,
and awarding acquisitions requiring intellectual property (IP),
data deliverables, and associated license rights. IP, data
deliverables, and associated license rights are required for the
operation, maintenance, installation, and training (OMIT);
modernization; and sustainment of Army systems and services
throughout a program’s lifecycle.</p>
            <p class="p">Historically, the acquisition of IP, data deliverables and
associated licenses has been constrained by the Government’s
inability to accurately define requirements, resulting in a number
of programs becoming “vendor locked” into sole source
agreements. The Government is now focused on reducing the number of
sole source arrangements, promoting competition to the maximum
extent practical, and avoiding or mitigating scenarios where a
small amount of proprietary technology restricts a competitive
re-procurement or sustainment of a system or service.</p>
            <p class="p">Title 10, U.S.C. § 2464(a)(1) states that the DoD must
maintain a “ready and controlled” source of technical
competencies and resources necessary to ensure effective and timely
response to mobilization, national defense contingency situations,
and other emergency requirements. In order to achieve that
objective, appropriate levels of IP, data deliverables, and
associated license rights must be obtained. The acquisition
authority for licensing, management of IP, data deliverables and
associated license rights is Title 10, U.S.C. Chapter 275,
Proprietary Contractor Data and Rights in Technical Data.</p>
            <p class="p">The Program Office is responsible for preparing an IP Strategy,
which is summarized, or wholly contained within, in the Acquisition
Strategy/Plan sent to the Contracting Officer. The IP Strategy is a
living document that identifies and manages the full spectrum of
required IP, data deliverables, and associated license rights from
inception of a program through the complete life cycle. The
continuous assessment of program needs can lead to achieving
greater competition and more affordable sustainment costs within
the business objectives of the program.</p>
            <p class="p">The information provided in this Appendix and referenced
templates are focused on generating thoughts and discussions among
and across the respective acquisition teams. Use and/or modify as
appropriate for individual acquisitions.</p>

              </strong>
            </p>
            <p class="p">When developing the comprehensive IP strategy and the capability
requirements for performance and sustainment, consider the
following in respect to IP, data deliverables, and associated
license rights (for additional information consult Army Directive
2018-26, Enabling Modernization Through the Management of
Intellectual Property.):</p>
            <p class="p">1. Develop an IP strategy that accounts for both short-term and
long-term needs, covering the full lifecycle of the system or
service. The IP strategy should continuously be assessed (e.g.,
sustainment reviews (SR)) and updated to reflect current status
(i.e. evolving technology, reduced program cost or schedule, etc.)
and desired goals/objectives. At a minimum, customize IP strategies
based on the common, shared, and unique characteristics of the
system and its components: system architecture and interfaces:
product support/sustainment strategy: organic industrial base
strategy of the DoD Component concerned; whether the item can be
found in the commercial market: and whether the standard commercial
licensing terms meet DoD needs. (NOTE: These can be considered
strengths during a tradeoff, but cannot be mandated.)</p>
            <p class="p">2. Determine the appropriate sustainment approach to use for the
IP strategy. The strategy should focus on achieving greater
competition and more affordable sustainment costs. Anticipate the
impact of sustainment costs within program business objectives over
the entire system or service lifecycle. (NOTE: This can be
considered a strength during a tradeoff, but cannot be
mandated.)</p>
            <p class="p">3. Determine what kind of data (e.g., form, fit, and function
data), software, and associated license rights are required/desired
for all stages of the acquisition life cycle, including operation,
maintenance, installation, and training (OMIT); modernization; and
sustainment. The IP strategy should be customized to meet specific
sustainment needs of the program (i.e., data deliverable and any
required computer software source code).</p>
            <p class="p">4. The Government should consider the following techniques for
securing data/software and associated/corresponding license
rights:</p>
            <p class="p">a. Consider including contract provisions providing for the
transfer of a detailed data/software package with the corresponding
license rights to the Government if the original contractor goes
out of business or drops the particular item from production.</p>
            <p class="p">b. Consider including data escrow provisions (see DFARS PGI
227.7203-2(b)(2)(ii)(D)).</p>
            <p class="p">5. Describe the Modular Open System Approach (MOSA) objectives
that drive modularity decisions to support the operational and
lifecycle needs. Describe how IP, and related matters, necessary to
support the program’s use of modular open systems approaches,
in accordance with 10 U.S.C. Sections §§ 3771-3775 and
§§4401 - 4403, will be addressed. This includes providing
guidance for how solicitations and contracts will:</p>
            <p class="p">a. Identify and require all major systems interfaces to be based
on widely supported and consensus-based standards (if available and
suitable), which are preferably non-proprietary.</p>
            <p class="p">b. Include requirements to acquire the appropriate IP rights in
such major systems interfaces.</p>
            <p class="p">c. Include appropriate requirements for other non-major systems
interfaces (e.g., interfaces necessary for segregation and
reintegration activities).</p>
            <p class="p">d. Include request for Government Purpose Rights, when
appropriate, for Circuit Card Assemblies in support of organic
industrial base (OIB) DSOR and DSOS capabilities.</p>
            <p class="p">6. Appropriately reflect the IP strategy in both the
solicitation and the resultant contract. Contents of both documents
should include the IP, data deliverables, and associated license
rights necessary to accomplish program objectives.</p>
            <p class="p">7. Request that offerors propose their own sustainment
transition plan (to transition sustainment from their organization
to the Government or another contractor) as an evaluation factor
(technical sub factor – Supportability and
Maintenance).</p>
            <p class="p">8. The Government should only seek the IP, data deliverables,
and associated license rights necessary to support the mission of
the program. In some instances, where offerors are willing to
provide the Government with additional license rights to technical
data and software, such additional costs may not be cost effective.
Having an evaluation factor in a competitive procurement
environment may drive down the associated costs for broader
technical data or software license rights.</p>
            <p class="p">9. Consult with a Government IP attorney on IP, data
deliverables, and associated license rights. Statutes and
regulations related to technical data, software, and associated
rights are set forth in 10 USC § Chapter 275 (and DFARS
227.7102-1, DFARS 227.7103-1, DFARS 227.7202-1, and DFARS
227.7203-1). The statute and DFARS regulations should be read
carefully before procuring any technical data or software. Ensure
the Government receives sufficient rights in technical data and
software to enable organic or competitively established sustainment
of items.</p>

            </p>
            <p class="p">Once the Government’s requirements are sufficiently
defined, market research in accordance with FAR Part 10, begins and
is a coordinated effort by the PM or MATDEVs and the PCO. The
market research technique utilized is at the discretion of the
acquisition professionals. When conducting market research,
consider the critical characteristics and needs of the requirement
to include the following with respect to IP, data deliverables, and
associated licensing rights:</p>
            <p class="p">1. Are there any hardware or software solutions that meet the
requirement(s) that were developed using Government funding? If so,
what?</p>
            <p class="p">2. Does Industry have any input to assist the Government in
reaching the Government’s objectives or meeting the
Government’s requirement(s)? If so, what?</p>
            <p class="p">3. Industry Standards</p>
            <p class="p">a. What are the usual terms in commercial transactions for the
sale of the product or service you require?</p>
            <p class="p">b. Are the license and other intellectual property rights
adequate for Government’s needs?</p>
            <p class="p">c. Are there any proprietary processes or materials (e.g., trade
secrets) that may limit future competition?</p>
            <p class="p">d. Do the commercial terms and conditions violate laws or
policies applicable to Government contracting?</p>
            <p class="p"> Note: Rights related to commercial software are
governed by the standard commercial software license agreement,
rather than any DFARS clauses.</p>
            <p class="p">e. Does the Government need/want to negotiate revisions to the
standard commercial software license agreement in instances where
the commercial software license agreement conflicts with Federal
procurement law or does not meet the Government user’s
needs?</p>
            <p class="p"> Note: In some instances, substantial revisions to the
standard commercial software license agreement (e.g., additional
software copies) may result in additional costs.</p>
            <p class="p">4. Technical Data Delivery Format</p>
            <p class="p">a. Contractors often do not have technical data in formats that
DoD typically expects to receive. The Government should be willing
to accept standard commercial data formats, to the maximum extent
practicable.</p>
            <p class="p">b. Competitive: What are industry standards for technical data
deliverable format(s)?</p>
            <p class="p">c. Sole Source: What is the contractor’s usual deliverable
format for technical data?</p>
            <p class="p">5. Technology Maturity</p>
            <p class="p">a. How much of the software and/or hardware is mature?</p>
            <p class="p">b. How much of the software and/or hardware is still in
development or testing?</p>
            <p class="p">c. What is the overall Technology Readiness Level (TRL)?</p>
            <p class="p">d. Software is typically not delivered 100 percent
“bug” free. It may take several years to mature. The
logistics product support/sustainment strategy should address
software maintenance including “bug” fixes.</p>
            <p class="p">6. Support and Sustainment</p>
            <p class="p">a. Offerors typically provide software bug fix support, but
length of support varies. The Government may consider bug fix
support (including cost, length, and scope of such support) during
source selection as a trade-off.</p>
            <p class="p"> Are software bug fixes supported?</p>
            <p class="p"> If so, how long are they supported?</p>
            <p class="p">b. Offerors may provide software upgrades and cybersecurity
updates. The Government may consider offeror provided software
upgrades (including cost, length, and scope of such support)</p>
            <p class="p"> Are software upgrades and cybersecurity updates
provided at no additional cost?</p>
            <p class="p"> If so, how long are they provided? What are the terms
and conditions?</p>
            <p class="p">c. Is there a plan to later modify deliverable hardware, data,
or software?</p>
            <p class="p">d. Will a data package be required?</p>
            <p class="p">e. Will access to support and support-related technical
information be obtained, for hardware and software, to
cost-effectively maintain the system at each of the designated
levels of maintenance and to foster competition for sources of
support throughout the life-cycle.</p>
            <p class="p">f. Will government purpose rights (GPR) to a Level 3 Technical
Data Package enable 3D Modeling for hardware to avoid vendor lock
and allow for hardware repairs within the organic industrial base
(OIB)?</p>
            <p class="p">7. Logistics</p>

to prospective offerors and to solicit proposals. When developing
the RFP, consider the following:</p>
            <p class="p">1. The RFP should clearly and effectively communicate the
Government’s IP and data rights priorities. Incorporate
delivery requirements and require offerors to assert their specific
restrictions, if any.</p>
            <p class="p">2. Establish a clear understanding of the IP, data deliverables,
and associated license rights requirements.</p>
            <p class="p">3. The required data or software must be a deliverable, assigned
to a CLIN and associated with a CDRL.</p>
            <p class="p">4. Be transparent in articulating IP, data deliverables, and
associated license rights requirements. Also, provide transparency
for requirements related to data for operation, maintenance,
installation, and training (OMIT); modernization; advanced/additive
manufacturing; and sustainment objectives with industry.</p>
            <p class="p">5. Communicate early with industry. Provide
details of the Army’s intended program product
support/sustainment strategy (including sustainment needs and broad
categories of data and/or software required).</p>
            <p class="p">6. Determine whether an offeror has the capability to deliver
license rights for technical data and computer software necessary
for depot level maintenance.</p>
            <p class="p">7. Consistent with 10 U.S.C. §§ 3771-3775, the
contractor or subcontractor is not required to sell or relinquish
to the Government any additional rights in technical data the
Government is not already entitled to as a condition of being
responsive to a solicitation or as a condition of contract award.
However, additional rights conveyed to the Government may be
considered part of a source selection tradeoff.</p>
            <p class="p">8. Once the technical data and/or software required to
complement the maintenance and supply support strategies has been
identified, include solicitation provisions and contract clauses
related to patent, data, and software license rights. Typical
clauses that should be considered for inclusion are:</p>

process in the DoD Source Selection Procedures (SSP), section
3.1.2.1, and applying the descriptions in the DoD SSP Table 2A

process in the DoD Source Selection Procedures, section 3.1.2.2,
and applying the descriptions in DoD SSP Table 3 Combined

applicable to the definitions in DoD SSP Table 2B.</p>
            <p class="p">Data rights cannot be a factor or subfactor. However, offerors
may be granted one or more strengths related to data rights for a
give factor or subfactor. Further, the Government cannot require
the offeror to relinquish its data rights beyond Government’s
statutory entitlement. The Government may not assign a weakness or
deficiency due to a lack of proposed data rights above the minimum
statutory entitlement.</p>
            <p class="p">Strength Examples:</p>
            <p class="p">1) Delivering technical data with license rights that facilitate
future competitive procurement;</p>
            <p class="p">2) Delivering items that are available in the commercial market
that can be procured by other contractors in a future competitive
procurement (even without providing detailed technical information
on these commercially available items); and/or</p>
            <p class="p">3) Delivering a Product Support/Sustainment Strategy that
includes Government purpose rights (licensing technical data to
alternate contractors who will be able to participate in future
competitive procurements).</p>

                <u class="ph u">Evaluation Considerations</u>
              </strong>
            </p>
            <p class="p">When assessing the proposed data rights, consider the
following:</p>

            <p class="p">1. The Government is entitled to an “unlimited rights
license” or an “unrestricted rights license” to
form, fit, and function data; and data necessary for operation,
maintenance, installation, and training, other than Detailed
Manufacturing and Process Data (under DFARS 252.227-7013(b)(1) and
DFARS 252.227-7015(b)(1)). Furthermore, the Government is entitled
to an “unlimited rights” license for studies, analyses,
and test data produced for the contract (when the testing was
specified as an element of performance) that relate to
non-commercial items, components, and processes. Thus, the
Government should review and validate the offeror’s data and
software rights assertions, in coordination with the
program’s attorney advisor, to ensure that the
offeror’s proposal reflects at least the license rights to
which the Government is entitled. (Note: For more detailed
information, refer to the Army Data and Rights Guide <a class="xref" href="http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/cpic/cp/docs/Army_Data_and_Data_Rights_Guide_1st_Edition_4_Aug_2015.pdf" target="_blank">
                <u class="ph u">http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/cpic/cp/docs/Army_Data_and_Data_Rights_Guide_1st_Edition_4_Aug_2015.pdf</u>
              </a>)</p>
            <p class="p">2. Negotiate data rights while still in a competitive
environment. These negotiations will likely require the Contracting
Officer to open discussions unless the solicitation provides
another methodology. Although data rights cannot be a factor or
subfactor, discussions/negotiations can be opened to negotiate any
element of a solicitation or proposal ( see sample language for
Sections L&amp;M to incorporate data rights as a possible strength
in the evaluation). Note: Certain Associated License Rights will be
granted by standard DFARS clauses. Additional Associated License
Rights may be applicable negotiated Special License Agreement or
commercial license agreement. However, the data delivery
requirements must be specified, case-by-case, in each individual
contract, and data deliverables must be clearly identified by CLINs
and CDRLs that are traceable to the PWS. Deferring the discussion
of data deliverables will likely put the Government at a
disadvantage, however, it is an option (see DFARS 252.227-7027
Deferred Ordering of Technical Data or Computer Software). If there
are no data deliverables, the Government cannot exercise its data
rights. The data rights and data deliverables should be negotiated
at the same time. The IP Strategy should continuously be updated to
forecast future sustainment needs so Government can obtain
competitive pricing for future activities.) The negotiated rights
shall be passed down to the subcontractor(s).</p>
            <p class="p">3. Ensure the solicitation requires the proposal to include the
supporting information necessary for the Government to validate
contractor’s ability to provide any proposed data rights. For
example:</p>
            <p class="p">a. The offeror’s proposal shall demonstrate the ability to
grant license rights for technical data and computer software
necessary for depot maintenance, if applicable.</p>
            <p class="p">b. Identify the software developer/owner. Determine if the
offeror wholly owns the rights necessary to make, use, sell, or
offer them for sale. Is there a third party software
developer/owner?</p>
            <p class="p">c. Determine if the offeror proposed third-party and/or utilizes
open source software. Will any of the third-party software be open
source?</p>
            <p class="p">4. With the assistance of a cognizant IP attorney, the
Government should conduct research to verify IP and data rights
assertions made by the offeror. If the Government has reason to
believe that the offeror incorrectly asserted that an item was
developed exclusively at private expense, the Government may audit
the offeror’s accounts with the assistance of the Defense
Contracting Audit Agency (DCAA). (NOTE: The Contracting Officer
should engage with DCAA as early in the process in the procurement
planning process as possible to determine DCAA’s availability
to assist.)</p>

      <p class="p">Small Business Participation Commitment Document (SBPCD) (Sample Format)</p>
      <p class="p">The SBPCD format is designed to streamline and bring uniformity to responses and evaluations for small business participation when required under FAR 15.304. The format is distinctly different than the small business subcontracting plan required for other than small businesses (FAR 52.219-9). Proposals addressing the extent of small business participation (SBPCDs) shall be submitted separately from small business subcontracting plans (DFARS 215.305(c)(i)(B). A copy of the SBPCD is recommended to be provided in your instructions to offerors or as an attachment to the RFP.</p>
      <p class="p"> 
         <strong class="ph b">Other than small businesses</strong> are required to complete a SBPCD which will be incorporated into the resulting award by reference or attachment as an enforceable contractual requirement. Offerors should propose the level of participation of small businesses (as a small business prime, joint venture, teaming arrangement, and/or small business subcontractors) in the performance of the acquisition relative to the objectives/goals set forth in the evaluation of this area.</p>

         <strong class="ph b">NOTE</strong>: Pursuant to Sections 8(d) of the Small Business Act, a business is considered small for government procurements if it does not exceed the size standard for the NAICS code that the prime contractor believes best describes the product or services being acquired. In other words, the size of the prime’s suppliers is determined by the applicable NAICS code of their joint venture, teaming partner, or subcontract, which may or may not be the same NAICS code as the one for your prime contract with the government.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">G-1</span> Definition</h4>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p">An online Reverse Auction (RA) is an internet-based (electronic commerce) acquisition tool that allows the government to procure goods and services from suppliers in a competitive environment in which sellers, anonymously, bid prices down until the auction is complete.</p>
      <p class="p">A reverse auction is simply the opposite of a traditional auction. In a traditional auction, the seller offers an item for sale and multiple potential buyers submit sequentially higher bids for the item. Conversely, in a reverse auction, there are multiple sellers of items that compete for the business of a single buyer. During this competition the sellers ultimately drive the price of the item down.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">G-2</span> Applicability to Best Value Acquisitions</h4>
        <div class="body conbody">
          <p class="p">Online RAs are legal as long as the identity of the bidders is
not disclosed. Online RA tools may be used as a pricing tool for
LPTAs or tradeoff acquisitions. For example, an RA tool can be used
as a pricing tool for a tradeoff acquisition after the completion
of technical discussion. You may conduct a reverse auction to
establish the offerors’ final prices, provide these prices,
along with the rest of the evaluation results, to the SSA for
his/her use in selecting the proposal that represents the best
value.</p>
          <p class="p">Potential benefits are reduced acquisition cycle time and
increased competition that in due course drive prices down as the
offerors have visibility of the other prices being proposed.
Additionally, the online RA process is inclusive, transparent, and
immediately advantageous to both government and industry.</p>
          <p class="p">FAR Subpart 4.5 supports the use of electronic commerce whenever
practical or cost-effective. Online RAs should be utilized when it
is anticipated that this method will deliver more value than the
use of other available procurement methods. Additionally, RAs are
more advantageous to the government in reducing acquisition cycle
time when the requirements are best suited for an RA
environment.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">G-3</span> Process</h4>
        <div class="body conbody">
          <p class="p">Online RAs are conducted using a variety of procedures and
automated tools. An agency may contract with an online auction
service to conduct the reverse auction, or it may conduct the
reverse auction itself using commercially available software.</p>
          <p class="p">In either case, the reverse auction must be conducted on a
secure website, and you must clearly state in the RFP the ground
rules for the auction, particularly when the bidding will start and
stop.</p>
          <p class="p">Effective 29 August 2024, updated FAR language, as cited at FAR
17.802(c )(4) and FAR 17.802(d)(5)(iii) and in turn revised
contract clause FAR 52.217-12 provides new guidance and awareness
to offerors and reverse auction service providers regarding
Government’s access, use and disclosure requirements as well
as the disposition instructions which contracting officers shall
provide in solicitations and resulting awards.</p>
