         those prescribed in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Defense Federal
         Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) as required in DFARS 201.304(4). This plan
         supersedes the July 31, 2009, update.</p>

         provisions and means a term or condition of the type set forth in FAR part 52 and DFARS
         part 252.</p>

         contracting activities coordinate all nonstandard clauses with the Office of the Deputy
         Assistant Secretary of the Army (Procurement) (ODASA(P)) Policy and Programs Directorate in
         accordance with Army Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFARS) 5101.304(1)(i). The
         ODASA(P) Policy and Programs Directorate coordinates with the Office of the Army General
         Counsel during review of nonstandard clauses.</p>

         significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors (DFARS 201.304(1)).
         Included are class deviations from the FAR or DFARS (DFARS 201.404(b)) and the six

         analysis through the Defense Acquisition Regulations (DAR) Council Director (DFARS

         (Procurement) (DASA(P)) approval to use clauses that do not require DPAP approval and do
         not require publication in the <i>Federal Register</i> for public comment, but are included
