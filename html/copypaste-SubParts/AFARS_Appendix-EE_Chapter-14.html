      <p class="p List1">a. Cardholders must contact their A/OPC or other
local authority (e.g., legal advisor, HCA, or resource manager)
before making purchases that seem questionable or have the
appearance of being inappropriate. When buying questionable items
or services, CHs must include approval documentation in the
purchase file.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. All exceptions must be on a per transaction
basis after consultation with the A/OPC, legal counsel, HCA, SCO,
CCO, or resource manager. Multiple requests for the same exception
must be approved by the Level 3 or 4 A/OPC responsible for issuing
the GPC accounts. There may be exceptions to the guidance in this
section. For example, the armed escort of prisoners may be a
legitimate use of the GPC even though “escort services”
qualify as a prohibited transaction. CHs must include the results
of their consultations and determination to use the GPC with their
transaction supporting data.</p>

      <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title2">
      <span class="ph autonumber">14-1.</span> Authorized Purchases</h2>
      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. An authorized purchase satisfies a current
mission-related need at a fair and reasonable price that meets all
legal and regulatory requirements. It meets the following five
criteria:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) <strong class="ph b">Lawful</strong>. Purchase is funded and
authorized by law or regulation, and the requested item/service
fits the appropriation which is being used. See 48 CFR 13.301(a)
and 31 USC 1301(a).</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) <strong class="ph b">Legitimate Government Need</strong>.
Request is for official purposes and not for the personal benefit
of a government employee.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) <strong class="ph b">Bona Fide Need (Current Year
Appropriation)</strong>. Request is for the need of the current
year of the appropriation. This rule does not prevent maintaining a
legitimate inventory at reasonable and historical levels. See 31
USC 1502.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) <strong class="ph b">Minimum Needs of the
Government</strong>. Request should not exceed what is truly
required. See FAR 11.103(c)(1).</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) <strong class="ph b">Fair and Reasonable Price</strong>.
Price charged is fair to both parties, considering the quality and
timeliness of performance and delivery. Micro-purchases may be
awarded without seeking competitive quotes if the CH or BO
considers the price to be reasonable. Cardholders should obtain
multiple quotes if they suspect that the price is not reasonable or
if buying a supply/service for which no comparable pricing is
readily available. See FAR 13.203(a)(3).</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Funding</strong>. Funds must be
committed and obligated prior to purchase. BOs must ensure that
sufficient funds are obligated within the financial system before
providing approval to the CH to make the purchase. CHs must screen
the purchase request to verify the BO has approved the requirement
to make the purchase. For CHs who use GFEBS, a purchase request
with sufficient funding must have L4 approval before the card is
swiped.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Contract Payments</strong>. If a valid
procurement requirement has resulted in the award of a government
contract, the GPC may be used as a method of payment against the
contract, even if the acquisition would otherwise be for a GPC
prohibited item.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">14-2.</span> Unauthorized Commitments and
Ratification</h2>
      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. An unauthorized commitment (UAC) is defined by
FAR 1.602-3(a) as “an agreement that is not binding solely
because the Government representative who made it lacked the
authority to enter into that agreement on behalf of the
Government.” See AFARS 5101.602-3-90. The only individuals
who can bind the Government are warranted contracting officers,
ordering officials, and cardholders acting within the limits of
their delegated authority. The primary factor in determining
whether a purchase is considered a UAC is contracting authority.
CHs have this authority from their appointment letter. When an
individual without contracting authority initiates a purchase, it
is considered a UAC. The designated CH is the only person
authorized to make purchases with a GPC.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. Payment for goods or services accepted for an
UAC may be made only through the ratification process. Payment
cannot be made unless a Contracting Officer has awarded a contract
or an authorized GPC holder acting within his or her delegation of
authority has ordered the item(s).</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Examples of Unauthorized
Commitments</strong>.</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) The Army receives services/supplies in which a
properly executed funding document and an authorized procurement
method (e.g., contract, BPA, or GPC) was not established prior to
the Government ordering the services/supplies.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Someone other than the CH contacts a vendor and
asks them to provide supplies or perform work, without the
CH’s knowledge and without prior approval of the billing
official.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) An individual without contracting authority
orders supplies or services.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) CH orders supplies or services exceeding their
procurement authority.</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) A vendor mistakes a request for information as
an order, ships the item, the receiver does not realize it is an
improper order and accepts the item rather than rejecting and
returning the item.</p>
        <p class="p List2">6) A contractor continues to perform a service
contract or provide leased/rented equipment after the expiration
date of the contract. This situation frequently occurs on yearly
services/maintenance/lease-type contracts for which there is a
continuing need.</p>
        <p class="p List2">7) An individual makes a commitment for
continuation of services over and above the original scope and
dollar amount, or delivery of supplies under an expired contract,
purchase order, or delivery order.</p>
        <p class="p List2">8) An individual makes a commitment which exceeds
the call order limit on a BPA.</p>
        <p class="p List2">9) A person who does not have delegated authority
makes a commitment under a BPA.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Common Reasons for UACs</strong>.</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Failure to plan procurement needs far enough in
advance to utilize normal contracting procedures.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Encountering emergency program requirements and
not believing there is enough time to go through normal procurement
procedures.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Failure to expeditiously review, approve, and
transmit procurement requests to the Procurement Office.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Failure to perform extensive market research
before taking an action.</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) Government officials not understanding the
parameters of their actual authority or lack thereof.</p>
        <p class="p List2">6) Government official not understanding that
agreeing to an option presented by a contractor could be an
unauthorized action if it creates more work or expense.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Ratification Process</strong>. AFARS
5101.602-3-90 outlines the Army process for ratifying an
unauthorized commitment. The Government accepts liability through
ratification. When an A/OPC identifies a potential unauthorized
commitment, the A/OPC must contact the local contracting office to
initiate the ratification process.</p>
        <p class="p List1">f. <strong class="ph b">Payment of Properly Ratified Claims
with the GPC.</strong> After the UAC is ratified, the payment of
the ratified claim may be made through an appropriate contract
action (e.g., award of a contract, modification to a contract,
purchase order, GPC). After ratification, the GPC may be used to
satisfy the commitment if the amount of payment is within the
cardholder’s authority. If the outstanding charges have
already been paid in error with the GPC prior to the discovery of
the UAC, the UAC is being processed for ratification only and the
supporting documentation is loaded in the bank’s EAS.</p>

settlements</strong>.</p>
        <p class="p List1">i. <strong class="ph b">Equipment, Systems, and Services Using
Covered Telecommunications Equipment or Services as a Substantial
Component or Critical Technology</strong>. FAR 13.201(j)(1)
prohibits use of the GPC to “procure, obtain, or extend or
renew a contract to procure or obtain, any equipment, system, or
service that uses covered telecommunications equipment or services
as a substantial or essential component of any system, or as a
critical technology as part of any system, unless an exception
applies or a waiver is granted.”</p>
        <p class="p List1">j. <strong class="ph b">Fines</strong>. Use of the GPC to
settle a commercial or governmental fine is generally
prohibited.</p>
        <p class="p List1">k. <strong class="ph b">Foreign currency</strong>.</p>
        <p class="p List1">l. <strong class="ph b">Gift Certificates and Gift
Cards</strong>. Buying gift certificates and cards is generally
prohibited. Gift certificates and gift cards are considered cash
advances and must not be purchased with the GPC, even to obtain
items from merchants that do not accept the GPC. As with cash and
near-cash, gift certificates and gift cards are prohibited because
they are easily misappropriated, and the award of gift certificates
or gift cards requires the submission of 1099 reports in accordance
with IRS regulations. The Army is required to file a form 1099-MISC
for payments to individuals totaling more than $600 in a tax
year.</p>
        <p class="p List1">m. <strong class="ph b">Perfluorooctane Sulfonate (PFOS) or
Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) Containing Items</strong>.
Cardholders must not procure any covered items that contain PFOS or
PFOA. Covered items include (1) nonstick cookware or cooking
utensils for use in galleys or dining facilities; and (2)
upholstered furniture, carpets, and rugs that have been treated
with stain-resistant coatings.</p>

        <p class="p List1">s. <strong class="ph b">Supplies or Services from military
personnel or civilian employees</strong> (e.g., when Government
employees are acting as vendors).</p>
        <p class="p List1">t. <strong class="ph b">Taxes.</strong> Use of the GPC for
personal tax payments is prohibited because personal expenses
cannot be charged to the GPC. As a Federal Government entity, DoD
is exempt from paying most taxes to any other Federal, State, or
local authority. (Some states, like New Mexico, levy taxes the
Federal Government must pay.) For more information, see the GSA
State Tax Exemption Information for Government Charge Cards.</p>
        <p class="p List1">u. <strong class="ph b">Tax on Certain Foreign
Procurements.</strong> CHs will not use the GPC as a method of
payment or purchase when a contract instrument contains FAR Clause
52.229-12, unless DFARS Clause 252.229-7014 is also present. In
certain circumstances, the Government must withhold a two percent
excise tax on foreign payments to vendors to comply with the FAR
and IRS regulations. The GPC does not provide a method to
accomplish this withholding. As a result, the GPC is prohibited
from being used.</p>
        <p class="p List1">v. <strong class="ph b">Telecommunication Systems</strong>. Use
of the GPC to purchase major telecommunication systems, such as
Federal Telecommunications System or Defense Switched Network (DSN)
systems, is prohibited. A contract vehicle is required because such
purchases include special terms and conditions. DFARS 239.74
governs DoD’s acquisition of telecommunications.</p>
        <p class="p List1">w. <strong class="ph b">TikTok</strong>. In accordance with FAR
13.201(k), the prohibition in FAR 4.2202 on use of a ByteDance
covered application (“TikTok”) applies to purchases at
or below the MPT where the performance of the contract may require
the presence or use of a covered application (e.g., where social
media advertising services might be part of the procurement),
unless an exception is granted.</p>

        <p class="p">The following list identifies supplies and services that are
generally prohibited from purchase. Under the following conditions,
the below items are allowable to purchase with the GPC.</p>
        <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">Advance Payments.</strong> Advance
payments are generally prohibited unless authorized by a specific
appropriation or other law. See 31 USC 3324. Exceptions include but
are not limited to subscriptions or training based on an SF 182,
Authorization, Agreement, Certification of Training. Advance
payments are authorized for Tuition Assistance in accordance with
AR 621-5. Limitations on advance payments do not apply to advance
payments authorized by law for subscriptions or publications.
Advance payment is authorized in 31 USC 3324(d)(2) for
“charges for a publication printed or recorded in any way for
the auditory or visual use of the agency.” CHs must place
subscription orders in the name of an organization or a position
title (e.g., Building Manager or Director, XXX Division) rather
than in the name of an individual employee. CHs must retain the
renewal notice or a statement that reflects the beginning and
ending date of the subscription service.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Business Cards</strong>. Commercial
printing of business cards is prohibited. Cardholders may use the
GPC to order business cards from AbilityOne and National Industries
for the Blind.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Bottled Water</strong>. Bottled water
is generally prohibited. Cardholders may use the GPC to buy water
when potable drinking water is not available on the premises or
when the drinking water currently provided or available on the
premises is harmful if consumed. Cardholders must obtain approval
from their legal advisor prior to purchase and include approval
documentation in the purchase file. (B- 247871, B-324781, B-310502,
and B-318588)</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Coins.</strong> Cardholders may use the
GPC to buy coins in accordance with the specified policy in HQDA
memo, Policy for the Procurement and Presentation of Coins, dated
14 December 2016.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Commercial Unmanned Aerial
Systems</strong>. Use of the GPC to purchase commercial unmanned
aerial systems (e.g., “drones”) is prohibited in the
DPCAP 15 August 2018 memorandum titled “Government-Wide
Commercial Purchase Card Prohibited Purchases.” See DPCAP 1
March 2019 memo titled “Limited Exception to the General
Government Wide Commercial Purchase Card Unmanned Aerial Systems
Purchasing Prohibition.”</p>
        <p class="p List1">f. <strong class="ph b">Conference Registration
Fees.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="p List2">1) <strong class="ph b">Local In-person Training
Conference</strong>. Cardholders should use the GPC to pay the
registration fee. Attendance may require conference approval from
chain of command and legal office.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) <strong class="ph b">Conference that Requires Official
Travel</strong>. Cardholders may use a GPC for a standalone,
advanced payment of the registration fee. Attendance may require
conference approval from chain of command and legal office.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) <strong class="ph b">Virtual Training Conference</strong>.
Cardholders should use a GPC to pay the registration fee.
Conference approval is not required per AR 1-50, 1-8.</p>
        <p class="p List1">g. <strong class="ph b">Food, Meals, and Refreshments</strong>.
In general, CHs may not use appropriated funds to purchase items
considered personal expenses, such as food, meals, and refreshments
without specific authority. Provided you have specific authority,
there may be limited exceptions that permit a CH to purchase food.
Additional information regarding acceptable food purchases is
available in the GAO publication, “Can Your Agency Use
Appropriated Funds for Meals and Light Refreshments?” When
purchasing food, CHs may use the GPC to buy disposable serving
materials (e.g., paper plates and napkins, plastic forks).
<strong class="ph b">Written legal and A/OPC approval is required for all food
purchases and must be included in the purchase file.</strong>
          <strong class="ph b">The below list identifies exemptions under which food may
be allowable if approved by the command and legal counsel. This
list is not all-inclusive.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="p List2">1) <strong class="ph b">Nongovernmental Meeting or
Conference</strong>. Cardholders may use GPC to pay for food if the
cost of food is a non-separable portion of a registration or
attendance fee that covers attendance and meals. CH may also use
the GPC if food is necessary to obtain full benefit of the meeting
or conference (B-233807, Aug. 27, 1990). Criteria used in
determining if an agency may pay for food for an employee attending
a nongovernmental meeting or conference:</p>
        <p class="p List3">i. Meals and refreshments are incidental to the
meeting or conference,</p>
        <p class="p List3">ii. Attendance at the meal or when refreshments
are provided is important to ensure the employees’ full
participation in the meeting or conference, and</p>
        <p class="p List3">iii. The meal and refreshments are part of a
formal conference or meeting that includes not just the meal and
refreshments and, discussions or speeches that may take place when
the meal and refreshments are served, but also substantial
functions separate from when the food is served.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) <strong class="ph b">Agency Paying for Food for an Employee
Attending a Government-Sponsored Conference</strong>. Cardholders
may use the GPC if food is necessary to obtain full benefit of the
conference and the conference involves matters of topical interest
to multiple agencies and/or nongovernmental participants. Also,
without statutory authority to charge a fee and retain the
proceeds, the host agency may not charge a registration or other
fee to defray the costs of providing food (B-198471, May 1, 1980,
and B-288266, Jan. 27, 2003). Criteria used in determining if an
agency may pay for food for an employee attending a
government-sponsored meeting or conference:</p>
        <p class="p List3">i. Meals and refreshments are incidental to the
meeting or conference,</p>
        <p class="p List3">ii. Attendance at the meal or when refreshments
are provided is important to ensure the employees’ full
participation in the meeting or conference, and</p>
        <p class="p List3">iii. The meal and refreshments are part of a
formal conference or meeting that includes not just the meal and
refreshments and discussions or speeches that may take place when
the meal and refreshments are served, but also substantial
functions separate from when the food is served.</p>
        <p class="p List3">iv. In addition, the meeting or conference may not
be a routine meeting that involves the day-to-day operations of the
government.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) <strong class="ph b">Agency Hosting a Formal
Conference.</strong> Cardholders may use the GPC if the conference
includes registration, published substantive agenda, and scheduled
speakers; the food is a legitimate conference expense; and the
conference involves matters of topical interest to multiple
agencies and/or nongovernmental participants. Also, without
statutory authority to charge a fee and retain the proceeds, the
host agency may not charge a registration or other fee to defray
the costs of providing food (B-300826, March 3, 2005). Criteria
used in determining when an agency, as host, may pay for food at a
formal conference:</p>
        <p class="p List3">i. Meals and refreshments are incidental to the
formal conference,</p>
        <p class="p List3">ii. Attendance at the meal or when refreshments
are provided is important for the host agency to ensure
attendees’ full participation in essential discussions and
speeches concerning the purpose of the formal conference, and</p>
        <p class="p List3">iii. The meal and refreshments are part of a
formal conference that includes not just the meal and refreshments
and discussions or speeches that may take place when the meal and
refreshments are served, but also substantial functions separate
from when the food is served.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) <strong class="ph b">Light Refreshments at
Government-sponsored Conferences</strong>. The agency sponsoring
the conference may use the GPC to provide light refreshments on
breaks at Government-sponsored conferences only for Government
employees on travel orders (TDY status). Use of GPC to buy
refreshments for non-Government employees or for Government
employees not on travel orders is prohibited.</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) <strong class="ph b">Agency Hosting a Focus Group</strong>.
Cardholders may use the GPC if the focus group advances a specific
statutory mission; the participants are federal employees; and the
expenditure contributes materially to the achievement of the
specific statutory function (B-304718, Nov. 9, 2005).</p>
        <p class="p List2">6) <strong class="ph b">Routine Agency Meeting Held to Discuss
the Internal Day-to-Day Operations of the Government</strong>.
Cardholders may use GPC if the meeting is held at an outside
facility, and the cost of food is included, at no extra charge, in
the fee for the conference space (B-281063, Dec. 1, 1999).</p>
        <p class="p List2">7) <strong class="ph b">Training</strong>. Cardholders may use
GPC if participation in the meal is necessary to obtain the full
benefit of the training (39 Comp. Gen. 119 (1959)). Sponsoring
agency may serve refreshments/meals at training where the food is
necessary to achieve the objectives of the training program. The
food must be incidental to the training, and the event must meet
the definition of training in 5 USC 4101(4). Attendees would fail
to complete the training if they missed the meal.</p>
        <p class="p List2">8) <strong class="ph b">Award Ceremony</strong>. Cardholders
may use GPC if the recipients will be publicly recognized, and the
authorized agency official has determined that food advances the
recognition of the awardee. Sponsoring agency may serve light
refreshments at award ceremonies honoring individuals recognized
under a Civilian Employee Incentive Award Program. Use of GPC to
pay for refreshments at the following types of ceremonies is
prohibited: retirement, promotion, graduation, recurring quarterly
recognition, commanders’ call, PCS, and longevity (65 Comp.
Gen. 738 (1986)).</p>
        <p class="p List2">9) <strong class="ph b">Cultural Awareness Ceremony</strong>.
Cardholders may use GPC if the food is part of a formal program
intended to advance EEO objectives and make the audience aware of
the cultural or ethnic history being celebrated. The food must be a
sample of the food of the culture and be offered as part of the
larger program to serve an educational function (B-301184, Jan. 15,
2004).</p>
        <p class="p List2">10) <strong class="ph b">Official Representational Funds

Cardholders may use the GPC for the Field Studies Program to pay
for administrative program costs and actual event execution costs
below the micro-purchase threshold. DoD training activities may pay
for expenditures in support of the Field Studies Program IAW DoDI

services during FSP field trips. See AR 12-15, Chapter
11-30a(2).</p>
        <p class="p List2">15) <strong class="ph b">Emergency Requirements</strong>. CHs
may use the GPC to purchase food in emergency circumstances where
the provision of food is incidental to the protection of human life
or Federal property (B-189003, July 5, 1977). This exception
applies in authorized emergency conditions that clearly present an
imminent danger to human life and/or destruction to federal
property and it was necessary to have employees assist in the
emergency response and/or maintain the essential functions of the
office for an extended period (53 Comp. Gen. 71 (1973) and
B189003). Emergency circumstances do not include situations where
employees are merely required to remain on duty beyond their
regular working hours, even if required to remain on duty for a
24-hour period (B-185159, Dec. 10, 1975). Further, emergency
circumstances do not include situations merely involving inclement
weather (68 Comp. Gen. 46 (1988)). Food is unauthorized in an event
where personnel were not engaged in activities to prevent imminent
danger to human life or Federal property but were only
investigating a dangerous situation which had already occurred.
Food purchases for this exception will depend on the facts and
circumstances present in each case. Occupations such as those of
policeman, firemen, security guards, are often required to be
performed under emergent and dangerous conditions and this fact
alone does not warrant departure from general rule against payment
for employees' meals from appropriated funds (B-185159, December
10, 1975).</p>

or a statement that reflects the beginning and ending date of the
subscription service. CHs must purchase mission-related
subscriptions to magazines, journals, and technical data in the
name of the agency only rather than in the name of an individual
employee. Advance payments are authorized for subscriptions to
prevent disruptions in service. Subscriptions must not have an
automatic renewal at the end of the subscription period. Before
leaving their role, CHs should notify their BO and A/OPC so that
the subscription may be cancelled or transferred to another account
as appropriate.</p>

travel-related expenses (e.g., metro fares, taxi, bus fares,
automated toll tools, and parking fees) are processed in accordance
with the JTR. For travel-related expenses, the GPC may be used only
to place orders and/or make payments against contracts awarded by
warranted Contracting Officers.</p>
        <p class="p List1">q. <strong class="ph b">Vehicle-related expenses.</strong>
These expenses are generally paid with the travel or fleet cards.
CHs may use GPC when the travel or fleet card is inappropriate,
e.g., NAF and Air Force vehicles. Use of the GPC to purchase
repairs on GSA fleet-operated vehicles is prohibited.</p>

Components with weapons, ammunition, explosives, and other
commodities listed in DFARS PGI 208.7006. DoD Components are to
submit their commodity requirements via MIPR to the assigned
Component in accordance with DFARS 208.7002 and DFARS PGI
208.7002-1. See Chapter 16 for exceptions to policy. CHs may

      <span class="ph autonumber">14-5.</span> Split Purchases</h2>
      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. A split purchase is the intentional breaking
down of a known requirement to stay within a CH’s single
purchase limit or the MPT to avoid other procurement methods or
competition requirements. Split purchases are prohibited with the
GPC (FAR 13.003(c)(2)). Direct requirements exceeding the MPT to
the contracting office. Cardholders and A/OPCs should check with
their legal advisor if unsure whether a proposed purchase would be
considered split.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. The requirement is the total quantity and price
known at the time of purchase. If a CH purchases as they become
aware of a requirement, the requirement is each purchase. If a CH
consolidates purchases and buys once a day, the requirement becomes
what was received during that day.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. Examples of split purchases include, but are
not limited to, the following:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) A single CH making multiple purchases from the
same merchant on the same day, the total of which exceeds the
single purchase limit, and the total requirement was known at the
time of the first purchase.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) A single CH purchasing the same/similar item(s)
from multiple merchants on the same day, the total of which exceeds
the single purchase limit, and the total was known at the time of
the first purchase.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) A single CH making multiple purchases of
similar items from the same or multiple merchants over a period of
time when the total requirement was known at time of the first
purchase and the value exceeds the single purchase limit.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Multiple CHs under the same supervision or BO
purchasing the same/similar item(s) the same day or in a compressed
timeframe when the total requirement is known at a given time and
exceeds the single purchase limit.</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) Requirements exceeding the MPT (e.g.,
requirements for monthly recurring services, in which the monthly
payment is less than the applicable services MPT, but the known
yearly total exceeds the MPT).</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">What is not a Split Purchase</strong>.
Sometimes transactions appear like a split purchase, but they do
not meet the definition and are allowable to purchase with the GPC.
See common examples below:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Multiple purchases to the same vendor which do
not exceed the single purchase limit or MPT.
<strong class="ph b">Example</strong>. A CH makes two separate $100 purchases
from the same vendor on the same day. This situation is not a split
purchase because the combined total of $200 is below the MPT.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Multiple purchases to the same vendor when the
CH purchases as requirements are received.
<strong class="ph b">Example</strong>. A CH receives a $6,000 purchase request
on Monday. He obtains funding and approval and places the order. On
Wednesday, the CH receives a purchase request from the same
customer to buy additional items from the same vendor for $5,000.
He obtains funding and approval and places a second order to the
same vendor. This situation is not a split purchase, because the CH
was unaware of the second request when he made the initial
purchase.</p>

(MAC)</h2>
      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. The servicing bank provides Merchant
Authorization Controls (MAC) in the form of Merchant Category Codes
(MCC) and Merchant Category Code Groups (MCCG). MCCs and MCCGs
categorize merchants by the goods and services they provide. They
are used within the servicing bank’s card processing system
to authorize or decline purchase transactions based on controls
established for each GPC account. An MCC is a four-character
numeric code with a corresponding description that reflects the
merchant’s primary business. An MCCG is a logical grouping of
MCCs.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Merchant Category Code (MCC)</strong>.
A code assigned by the merchant’s bank to categorize each
merchant according to the type of business in which the merchant is
engaged and the kinds of supplies or services provided. These codes
are used as authorized transaction codes on a card/account to
identify the types of businesses providing authorized supplies or
services. DPCAP maintains the list of DoD-wide blocked MCC codes.
The servicing bank uses MasterCard’s MCCs to categorize
merchants based on the types of goods or services they provide.
When an A/OPC adds MCCs to a Cardholder or Managing Account
profile, it enables that specific account to make purchases from
vendors categorized under that MCC.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Tier 1 MCCs</strong>. The servicing
bank has placed a hard block on merchants with Tier 1 (Very High
Risk) MCCs. The bank will decline all attempted transactions from
vendors with these MCCs. Tier 1 MCCs may be unblocked upon approval
by the Level 2 A/OPC, on a case-by-case basis. All purchases from
merchants associated with Tier 1 MCCs will generate a data mining
case in IOD.</p>

considered high risk, and their blocking can be customized within
the servicing bank. Level 3 A/OPCs may authorize purchase from
vendors with Tier 2 MCCs on a case- by-case basis. Purchases from
merchants associated with these MCCs will not automatically
generate a case in IOD. A complete list of Tier 1 and 2 MCCs are

        <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">MCC Blocking</strong>. MCC blocking is
a designation attached to an account, which prevents a specified
MCC group from being charged (e.g., casinos, pawn shops). The
blocking is established by attaching a merchant authorization
control to a cardholder and/or managing account. If authorized MCCs
are attached and set to approve, then non-authorized MCCs are
effectively blocked. If non-authorized MCCs are attached and set to
decline, then those MCCs are blocked and all other MCCs are
effectively authorized.</p>
        <p class="p List1">f. <strong class="ph b">Requests to Override an MCC
Block</strong>. When requesting to override an MCC block, the CH or
BO must provide the following information to the A/OPC.</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Merchant name and address</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Item/service description</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Exact dollar amount of the transaction</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Estimated date of the purchase</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) CH name and last four digits of the card
account number</p>

than the merchant with the blocked MCC</p>
        <p class="p List2">8) Blocked MCC, if known</p>
        <p class="p">The Level 4 A/OPC will forward the request to the appropriate
higher-level A/OPC for approval. Upon approval, the Level 4 A/OPC
will update the merchant authorization control in the CH account to
allow the transaction to process. The CH asks the vendor to
resubmit the charge. After the transaction has processed, the Level
4 A/OPC will reapply the merchant authorization control to the CH
account.</p>
        <p class="p List1">g. <strong class="ph b">Erroneous MCCs</strong>. When a GPC
transaction is declined due to an erroneously identified code, the
CH must contact the servicing bank to determine what code is
necessary to complete the transaction with the declining merchant.
The BO and CH should contact the A/OPC to discuss a change to the
CH’s merchant authorization controls. Appropriate
authorization is required when Tier 1 or Tier 2 MCC is the
concern.</p>
