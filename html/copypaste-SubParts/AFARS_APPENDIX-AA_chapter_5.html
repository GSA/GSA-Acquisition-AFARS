questionnaires or interviews that have not been finalized within a
formal rating system. A best practice can be to discuss adverse
past performance which caused a rating to be lowered to
Satisfactory Confidence.</p>

part of the subjective tradeoff source selection process, the DoD
Source Selection Procedures allows for the use of entry-gate
criteria. This is considered a combination approach utilizing
concepts from both LPTA and Subjective Tradeoff. When determining
your evaluation criteria, the PM and the PCO should closely examine
the key requirements and carefully consider whether some objective
elements (i.e., entry-gate criteria) could be evaluated using an
acceptable/unacceptable or pass/fail rating methodology. During the
evaluation of proposals, offerors must be determined to be
acceptable or pass the entry-gate criteria in order to advance in
the subjective tradeoff evaluation. When the requirement can be
clearly stated with a corresponding standard of proof, using this
combination approach with entry-gate criteria can simplify and
streamline the evaluation process. See also Appendix C for more
information on acceptable/ unacceptable criteria.</p>

(LET) using VATEP, and one of the requirements is maximum payload.
The threshold is 80,000 lbs., and the objective is 85,000. As
stated in the RFP, During Step 2 of the VATEP process the SST will
adjust each offeror’s total proposed price (TPP) to derive
the total evaluated price (TEP) by $1,000 for each 50 lbs. of
increased payload over the threshold, for a maximum adjustment to
the TEP of $100,000. This adjustment is for evaluation purposes
only, and will not change the proposed pricing, which will become
the awarded price. If an offeror proposes the threshold for
payload, then they will receive no adjustment.</p>
          <p class="p">In this example, four proposals are received:</p>
          <p class="p"> Offeror A: TPP=$1,050,000; at least an
“acceptable” rating for all minimum requirements,
proposes a maximum payload of 83,500 lbs., an increase of 3,500
lbs. over the threshold.</p>
          <p class="p"> Offeror B: TPP=$1,000,000; at least an
“acceptable” rating for all minimum requirements,
proposes the threshold maximum payload of 80,000 lbs.</p>
          <p class="p"> Offeror C: TPP=$1,150,000; at least an
“acceptable” rating for all minimum requirements,
proposes a maximum payload at the objective level of 85,000 lbs.,
an increase of 5,000 lbs. over the threshold</p>
          <p class="p"> Offeror D: TPP=$950,000; “unacceptable” for
two minimum requirements, proposes a maximum payload at the
objective level of 85,000 lbs., an increase of 5,000 lbs. over the
threshold. <em class="ph i">Offeror D is eliminated in Step 1.</em>
          </p>
          <p class="p">At the conclusion of Step 1, offeror B has the lowest TPP, with
offeror A as the second-lowest cost/price and Offeror C as the
highest price. However, offerors A and C have their TPPs adjusted
since they have proposed maximum payloads above the threshold,
while offeror B has no adjustment since they have proposed only the
threshold maximum payload. The TEP adjustments are as follows:</p>
          <p class="p"> Offeror A has proposed an increase of 3,500 lbs., which
leads to a decrease of their TPP by $70,000, for a TEP of
$980,000.</p>
          <p class="p"> Offeror B has proposed the threshold and receives no
adjustment to their TPP. Therefore, their TEP is $1,000,000.</p>
          <p class="p"> Offeror C has a proposed increase of 5,000 lbs., which
leads to a decrease of their TPP by the maximum amount of $100,000,

each 50 lbs. of increased payload, the total evaluated price (TEP)
will be reduced by $1,000, for a maximum adjustment to TEP of
$100,000. No credit will be provided above the maximum for
performance over the objective.</p>

lack of understanding of when it is an appropriate choice may
result in misapplication of this process. This Appendix includes

Guide, is reference to DFARS 215.101-2-70 Limitations and

officers are required to avoid using LPTA or are prohibited from
using the process.</p>
          <p class="p">The use of LPTA has increased but not necessarily successfully
in all cases, causing concern by both the government and industry
partners. Some specific concerns include:</p>
          <p class="p"> Government officials are not able to adequately define
the requirement and, therefore, not able to adequately define
technical acceptability.</p>
          <p class="p"> Awarded prices are unrealistically low.</p>
          <p class="p">o Incumbent contractors underbid at unrealistic prices.</p>
          <p class="p">o Winning contractors cannot attract qualified employees.</p>
          <p class="p">o Contractors are unable to perform at acceptable quality
levels.</p>

            <strong class="ph b">Introduction</strong>
          </p>
      <p class="p">Oral presentations, as presented at FAR Part 15.102, provides
offerors an opportunity to substitute or augment written
information and can be conducted in person, via video
teleconferencing, or a mix of the two. Pre-recorded videotaped
presentations do not constitute an oral presentation since it does
not represent a real-time exchange of information, however,
recordings may be included in offeror submissions when
appropriate.</p>
      <p class="p">Oral presentations can be beneficial in a variety of
acquisitions and are most useful when the requirements are clear,
complete, and are stated in performance or functional terms. Oral
presentations may be ideal for gathering information related to how
well offerors understand, will approach, and qualifications
offerors are to perform required work.</p>
      <p class="p">
            <strong class="ph b">Scope of the Oral Presentation</strong>
          </p>
      <p class="p">Before deciding if oral presentations will be allowed for a
given acquisition, the PCO or SSA must first consider and determine
if applicable state or country privacy laws will impact and or
restrict recordings of presenters/presentations. If oral
presentations are deemed acceptable, the PCO or SSA then decides if
the information needed to be evaluated and if factors and subfactor
criteria is best presented orally, in writing, or through a
combination of both means.</p>
      <p class="p">Oral presentations cannot be incorporated into the contract by
reference, so any information to be made part of the contract needs
to be submitted in writing. At a minimum, the offeror must submit
certifications, representations, and a signed offer sheet
(including any exceptions to the government’s terms and
conditions) in writing. Additionally, as a rule of thumb, the
offeror must submit other hard data ("facts"), such as pricing or
costing data and contractual commitments, as part of the written
proposal.</p>
      <p class="p List1">Oral presentations can convey information in such
diverse areas as responses to sample tasks, understanding the
requirements, experience, and relevancy of past performance.</p>
      <p class="p"> 
         <img class="image" src="Graphics/imageD-5_1.jpeg">
      </p>
      <p class="p">Require offerors to submit their briefing materials in advance
of the presentations. This will allow government attendees an
opportunity to review the materials and prepare any associated
questions.</p>
      <p class="p">
            <strong class="ph b">Request for Proposal Information</strong>
          </p>
      <p class="p">If oral presentations are appropriate, all offerors must be
notified in the RFP that the government will use oral presentations
to evaluate and select the contractor. The proposal preparation
instructions must contain explicit instructions and guidance
regarding the extent and nature of the process that will be used.
Elaborate presentations should be discouraged since they may
detract from the information being presented. At a minimum, include
the following information in the RFP:</p>
      <p class="p"> The types of information the offeror must address
during the oral presentations and how it relates to the evaluation
criteria,</p>
      <p class="p"> The required format and content of the presentation
charts and any supporting documentation,</p>
      <p class="p"> Any restrictions on the number of charts, the number of
bullets per chart, and how material/ documentation will be handled
that does not comply with the restrictions,</p>
      <p class="p"> The required submission date for presentation charts
and/or materials,</p>
      <p class="p"> The approximate timeframe when the oral presentations
will be conducted and how the order of the offerors’
presentations will be determined,</p>
      <p class="p"> Whether any rescheduling will be permitted if an
offeror requests a change after the schedule has been
established,</p>
      <p class="p"> The total amount of time each offeror will have to
conduct their oral presentation,</p>
      <p class="p"> Who will make the presentation and a requirement that
the offeror provide a list of names and position titles of
presenters,</p>
      <p class="p"> Whether presentations will be by video, or audio
taped,</p>
      <p class="p"> The location and a description of the presentation site
and resources available to offerors,</p>
      <p class="p"> Any rules and/or prohibitions regarding equipment and
media,</p>
      <p class="p"> How will documents or information referenced in the
presentation material but never presented orally be treated,</p>
      <p class="p"> Any limitations on Government-Offeror interactions
during and or after presentations,</p>
      <p class="p"> Whether presentations will constitute discussions
(S<em class="ph i">ee Fi</em>
            <span class="ph" id="AFARS_Appendix-AA_d-5__Hlt507979103"></span>
            <em class="ph i">gu</em>
            <span class="ph" id="AFARS_Appendix-AA_d-5__Hlt500841769"></span>
            <em class="ph i">re 3-3</em>),</p>
      <p class="p"> Whether use of information provided during oral
presentations is solely for source selection purposes, or whether
information will become part of the contract (which will in turn
require a subsequent written submission of that information),
and</p>
      <p class="p"> Whether offerors should include any cost/price data in
their presentations.</p>
      <p class="p">
            <strong class="ph b">Timing and Sequencing</strong>
          </p>
      <p class="p" id="AFARS_Appendix-AA_d-5__Hlt498144211">Oral presentations can be conducted either before or after
establishing the competitive range.
When oral presentations are the only means of proposal submission,
they must be presented by all offerors. If oral presentations are
conducted prior to establishing the competitive range, care must be
taken to ensure the presentations do not result in discussions.</p>
      <p class="p">Since preparing and presenting oral presentations involves time
and expense, thought should be given regarding requiring offerors
who are not likely to be serious candidates for award having to
conduct oral presentations. This can be an important consideration
with some small businesses. When this is or will likely be a
concern, it is recommended to establish the competitive range prior
to oral presentations and clearly articulate the methodology and
order of process in the RFP.</p>
      <p class="p">The PCO will often draw lots to determine sequence of the
offerors’ presentations. The time between the first and the
last presentations should be as short as possible to minimize any
perceived or actual advantages to the offerors that present later
in the sequence.</p>
      <p class="p">
            <strong class="ph b">Time Limits</strong>
          </p>
      <p class="p">Establish a total time limit for each offeror’s
presentation. It is not advisable to limit the time for individual
topics or sections within the presentation as this detail is at the
discretion of and is the presenter’s responsibility to
decide. If planning a question-and-answer session, it is excluded
from the allotted time for presentations and a separate time limit
it is established.</p>
      <p class="p">There is no ideal amount of time to be allotted for
presentations and or question-and-answer sessions. The decision of
how much time to allocate is determined based on prudent business
judgment supported by the complexity of the acquisition and the
PCO’s or others’ experience and lessons learned.</p>
      <p class="p">
            <strong class="ph b">Facility</strong>
          </p>
      <p class="p">Ideally presentations will be conducted in a facility and
environment that can be controlled. This helps guard against
interruptions, distractions, and helps to ensure a more level
playing field for all offerors and presenters. Nothing precludes
oral presentations being conducted at offeror's facilities. This
may be more efficient if site visits, or other demonstrations are
part of the source selection process.</p>
      <p class="p List1">If using a government-controlled facility it
should be made available for a pre-inspection, and if warranted a
brief run-through of the agenda and order of events. Allowing
offerors to get acquainted with the facility can help to minimize
distractions during the presentation of content.</p>
      <p class="p">
            <strong class="ph b">Recording the Presentations</strong>
          </p>
      <p class="p">Having an exact record of the presentation can prove useful
during the evaluation process, and in the event of a protest or
litigation. Oral presentations can be recorded using a variety of
media, e.g., videotapes, audio tapes, written transcripts, or a
copy of the offeror’s briefing slides or presentation notes.
The SSA is responsible for determining the method and level of
detail of the record.</p>
      <p class="p" id="AFARS_Appendix-AA_d-5__OLE_LINK18">
            <strong class="ph b">
              <em class="ph i">Recording the presentation by some
appropriate means is not only required by FAR 15.1029(e), but it
also makes good business sense.</em>
            </strong>
          </p>
      <p class="p">If using videotaping, allow for the natural behavior of the
presenters. If slides or view graphs are used, the camera should
view both the podium and screen at the same time. Microphones shall
be placed so that all communications can be recorded clearly and at
adequate volume. Every effort should be made to avoid letting the
recording become the focus of the presentation.</p>
      <p class="p">The recording, which is considered source selection information,
will become part of the official record. A copy of the recording
shall be provided to the offeror, with the master copy sealed and
securely stored by the government to ensure there are no
allegations of tampering in the event of a protest or court
action.</p>
      <p class="p">
            <strong class="ph b">Government Attendance</strong>
          </p>
      <p class="p">The PCO should chair every presentation. All of the government
personnel involved in evaluating the presentations should attend
every presentation.</p>
      <p class="p">
            <strong class="ph b">Presenters</strong>
          </p>
      <p class="p">The offeror’s key personnel who will perform or personally
direct the work being described should conduct their relevant
portions of the presentations. Key personnel include project
managers, task leaders, and other in-house staff of the offerors,
or their prospective key subcontractors’ organizations. This
will avoid the oral presentation becoming the domain of a
professional presenter, which would increase costs, detract from
the advantages of oral presentations, and adversely affect small
businesses.</p>
      <p class="p">
            <strong class="ph b">Reviewing the Ground Rules</strong>
          </p>
      <p class="p">Prior to each presentation, the PCO shall review the ground
rules with the attendees. This includes discussing any restrictions
on Government-Offeror information exchanges, information disclosure
rules, documentation requirements, and housekeeping items. These
ground rules should also be included in the RFP.</p>
      <p class="p">If using a quiz as part of your evaluation, the PCO needs to
discuss the related ground rules. For example, can the offeror
caucus or contact outside sources by cell phone before
answering?</p>
      <p class="p" id="AFARS_Appendix-AA_d-5__Hlt498145303">Too much control and regulation should be avoided since it will
inhibit the exchange of information. However, if intent is to avoid
discussions, the PCO should control all exchanges during the
presentations. If conducting oral presentations after opening
discussions, compliance with FAR 15.306 and 15.307 is
required.</p>
      <p class="p List1">
            <strong class="ph b">Evaluation of Presentations</strong>
          </p>
      <p class="p">Evaluations should be performed immediately after each
presentation. Using preprinted evaluation forms will help the
evaluators collect their thoughts and impressions. Remember, even
if preprinted forms are used, evaluators have to provide the
rationale for their conclusions.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">E-1.1</span> Purpose</h4>
          <div class="body conbody">
            <p class="p">The purpose of Appendix E is to provide acquisition
professionals with guidance and/or best practices for conducting
market research, developing solicitations, evaluating proposals,
and awarding acquisitions requiring intellectual property (IP),
data deliverables, and associated license rights. IP, data
deliverables, and associated license rights are required for the
operation, maintenance, installation, and training (OMIT);
modernization; and sustainment of Army systems and services
throughout a program’s lifecycle.</p>
            <p class="p">Historically, the acquisition of IP, data deliverables and
associated licenses has been constrained by the Government’s
inability to accurately define requirements, resulting in a number
of programs becoming “vendor locked” into sole source
agreements. The Government is now focused on reducing the number of
sole source arrangements, promoting competition to the maximum
extent practical, and avoiding or mitigating scenarios where a
small amount of proprietary technology restricts a competitive
re-procurement or sustainment of a system or service.</p>
            <p class="p">Title 10, U.S.C. § 2464(a)(1) states that the DoD must
maintain a “ready and controlled” source of technical
competencies and resources necessary to ensure effective and timely
response to mobilization, national defense contingency situations,
and other emergency requirements. In order to achieve that
objective, appropriate levels of IP, data deliverables, and
associated license rights must be obtained. The acquisition
authority for licensing, management of IP, data deliverables and
associated license rights is Title 10, U.S.C. Chapter 275,
Proprietary Contractor Data and Rights in Technical Data.</p>
            <p class="p">The Program Office is responsible for preparing an IP Strategy,
which is summarized, or wholly contained within, in the Acquisition
Strategy/Plan sent to the Contracting Officer. The IP Strategy is a
living document that identifies and manages the full spectrum of
required IP, data deliverables, and associated license rights from
inception of a program through the complete life cycle. The
continuous assessment of program needs can lead to achieving
greater competition and more affordable sustainment costs within
the business objectives of the program.</p>
            <p class="p">The information provided in this Appendix and referenced
templates are focused on generating thoughts and discussions among
and across the respective acquisition teams. Use and/or modify as
appropriate for individual acquisitions.</p>

              </strong>
            </p>
            <p class="p">When developing the comprehensive IP strategy and the capability
requirements for performance and sustainment, consider the
following in respect to IP, data deliverables, and associated
license rights (for additional information consult Army Directive
2018-26, Enabling Modernization Through the Management of
Intellectual Property.):</p>
            <p class="p">1. Develop an IP strategy that accounts for both short-term and
long-term needs, covering the full lifecycle of the system or
service. The IP strategy should continuously be assessed (e.g.,
sustainment reviews (SR)) and updated to reflect current status
(i.e. evolving technology, reduced program cost or schedule, etc.)
and desired goals/objectives. At a minimum, customize IP strategies
based on the common, shared, and unique characteristics of the
system and its components: system architecture and interfaces:
product support/sustainment strategy: organic industrial base
strategy of the DoD Component concerned; whether the item can be
found in the commercial market: and whether the standard commercial
licensing terms meet DoD needs. (NOTE: These can be considered
strengths during a tradeoff, but cannot be mandated.)</p>
            <p class="p">2. Determine the appropriate sustainment approach to use for the
IP strategy. The strategy should focus on achieving greater
competition and more affordable sustainment costs. Anticipate the
impact of sustainment costs within program business objectives over
the entire system or service lifecycle. (NOTE: This can be
considered a strength during a tradeoff, but cannot be
mandated.)</p>
            <p class="p">3. Determine what kind of data (e.g., form, fit, and function
data), software, and associated license rights are required/desired
for all stages of the acquisition life cycle, including operation,
maintenance, installation, and training (OMIT); modernization; and
sustainment. The IP strategy should be customized to meet specific
sustainment needs of the program (i.e., data deliverable and any
required computer software source code).</p>
            <p class="p">4. The Government should consider the following techniques for
securing data/software and associated/corresponding license
rights:</p>
            <p class="p">a. Consider including contract provisions providing for the
transfer of a detailed data/software package with the corresponding
license rights to the Government if the original contractor goes
out of business or drops the particular item from production.</p>
            <p class="p">b. Consider including data escrow provisions (see DFARS PGI
227.7203-2(b)(2)(ii)(D)).</p>
            <p class="p">5. Describe the Modular Open System Approach (MOSA) objectives
that drive modularity decisions to support the operational and
lifecycle needs. Describe how IP, and related matters, necessary to
support the program’s use of modular open systems approaches,
in accordance with 10 U.S.C. Sections §§ 3771-3775 and
§§4401 - 4403, will be addressed. This includes providing
guidance for how solicitations and contracts will:</p>
            <p class="p">a. Identify and require all major systems interfaces to be based
on widely supported and consensus-based standards (if available and
suitable), which are preferably non-proprietary.</p>
            <p class="p">b. Include requirements to acquire the appropriate IP rights in
such major systems interfaces.</p>
            <p class="p">c. Include appropriate requirements for other non-major systems
interfaces (e.g., interfaces necessary for segregation and
reintegration activities).</p>
            <p class="p">d. Include request for Government Purpose Rights, when
appropriate, for Circuit Card Assemblies in support of organic
industrial base (OIB) DSOR and DSOS capabilities.</p>
            <p class="p">6. Appropriately reflect the IP strategy in both the
solicitation and the resultant contract. Contents of both documents
should include the IP, data deliverables, and associated license
rights necessary to accomplish program objectives.</p>
            <p class="p">7. Request that offerors propose their own sustainment
transition plan (to transition sustainment from their organization
to the Government or another contractor) as an evaluation factor
(technical sub factor – Supportability and
Maintenance).</p>
            <p class="p">8. The Government should only seek the IP, data deliverables,
and associated license rights necessary to support the mission of
the program. In some instances, where offerors are willing to
provide the Government with additional license rights to technical
data and software, such additional costs may not be cost effective.
Having an evaluation factor in a competitive procurement
environment may drive down the associated costs for broader
technical data or software license rights.</p>
            <p class="p">9. Consult with a Government IP attorney on IP, data
deliverables, and associated license rights. Statutes and
regulations related to technical data, software, and associated
rights are set forth in 10 USC § Chapter 275 (and DFARS
227.7102-1, DFARS 227.7103-1, DFARS 227.7202-1, and DFARS
227.7203-1). The statute and DFARS regulations should be read
carefully before procuring any technical data or software. Ensure
the Government receives sufficient rights in technical data and
software to enable organic or competitively established sustainment
of items.</p>

Requirement language regarding background patent rights.</p>
                      <p class="p">13. Consider adding in Section H – Special Contract
Requirement language regarding Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA)
– including interfaces, patent and data rights, and data
deliverables.</p>
                      <p class="p">14. If the IP strategy includes recompeting a system, subsystem,
or component, consider requesting the offeror’s proposed
terms and conditions for delivering a Technical Data Package (TDP)
that grants rights to the TDP for the system/subsystem/component.
Proposal shall clearly outline the terms and conditions, all
associated costs, and any minimum quantity (if applicable), in
addition to providing the Government with the capability to obtain
an IP license from the date of notification of award. Government
should be granted sufficient IP rights including technical data
rights and background patent rights necessary to allow the
Government to compete the design, potentially secure additional
sources for the system/subsystem/component, and/or use submitted
technical data on any other Government programs.</p>
                      <p class="p">15. Consider the use of escrow. A data escrow account is an
account, held by a third-party or even a prime (provided the prime
is not the owner of the data to be placed in escrow), which is
populated by the offeror with designated technical data, computer
software, and/or computer software documentation (“the escrow
data”) and will only be released to the Government under
specified, mutually agreed to, conditions.</p>

            </p>
            <p class="p">Once the Government’s requirements are sufficiently
defined, market research in accordance with FAR Part 10, begins and
is a coordinated effort by the PM or MATDEVs and the PCO. The
market research technique utilized is at the discretion of the
acquisition professionals. When conducting market research,
consider the critical characteristics and needs of the requirement
to include the following with respect to IP, data deliverables, and
associated licensing rights:</p>
            <p class="p">1. Are there any hardware or software solutions that meet the
requirement(s) that were developed using Government funding? If so,
what?</p>
            <p class="p">2. Does Industry have any input to assist the Government in
reaching the Government’s objectives or meeting the
Government’s requirement(s)? If so, what?</p>
            <p class="p">3. Industry Standards</p>
            <p class="p">a. What are the usual terms in commercial transactions for the
sale of the product or service you require?</p>
            <p class="p">b. Are the license and other intellectual property rights
adequate for Government’s needs?</p>
            <p class="p">c. Are there any proprietary processes or materials (e.g., trade
secrets) that may limit future competition?</p>
            <p class="p">d. Do the commercial terms and conditions violate laws or
policies applicable to Government contracting?</p>
            <p class="p"> Note: Rights related to commercial software are
governed by the standard commercial software license agreement,
rather than any DFARS clauses.</p>
            <p class="p">e. Does the Government need/want to negotiate revisions to the
standard commercial software license agreement in instances where
the commercial software license agreement conflicts with Federal
procurement law or does not meet the Government user’s
needs?</p>
            <p class="p"> Note: In some instances, substantial revisions to the
standard commercial software license agreement (e.g., additional
software copies) may result in additional costs.</p>
            <p class="p">4. Technical Data Delivery Format</p>
            <p class="p">a. Contractors often do not have technical data in formats that
DoD typically expects to receive. The Government should be willing
to accept standard commercial data formats, to the maximum extent
practicable.</p>
            <p class="p">b. Competitive: What are industry standards for technical data
deliverable format(s)?</p>
            <p class="p">c. Sole Source: What is the contractor’s usual deliverable
format for technical data?</p>
            <p class="p">5. Technology Maturity</p>
            <p class="p">a. How much of the software and/or hardware is mature?</p>
            <p class="p">b. How much of the software and/or hardware is still in
development or testing?</p>
            <p class="p">c. What is the overall Technology Readiness Level (TRL)?</p>
            <p class="p">d. Software is typically not delivered 100 percent
“bug” free. It may take several years to mature. The
logistics product support/sustainment strategy should address
software maintenance including “bug” fixes.</p>
            <p class="p">6. Support and Sustainment</p>
            <p class="p">a. Offerors typically provide software bug fix support, but
length of support varies. The Government may consider bug fix
support (including cost, length, and scope of such support) during
source selection as a trade-off.</p>
            <p class="p"> Are software bug fixes supported?</p>
            <p class="p"> If so, how long are they supported?</p>
            <p class="p">b. Offerors may provide software upgrades and cybersecurity
updates. The Government may consider offeror provided software
upgrades (including cost, length, and scope of such support)</p>
            <p class="p"> Are software upgrades and cybersecurity updates
provided at no additional cost?</p>
            <p class="p"> If so, how long are they provided? What are the terms
and conditions?</p>
            <p class="p">c. Is there a plan to later modify deliverable hardware, data,
or software?</p>
            <p class="p">d. Will a data package be required?</p>
            <p class="p">e. Will access to support and support-related technical
information be obtained, for hardware and software, to
cost-effectively maintain the system at each of the designated
levels of maintenance and to foster competition for sources of
support throughout the life-cycle.</p>
            <p class="p">f. Will government purpose rights (GPR) to a Level 3 Technical
Data Package enable 3D Modeling for hardware to avoid vendor lock
and allow for hardware repairs within the organic industrial base
(OIB)?</p>
            <p class="p">7. Logistics</p>
            <p class="p">a. What is the approximate period of time required to prepare
validated procedures addressing software and configuration file
loading and to maintain the software baseline?</p>
            <p class="p">b. What period of time is required to transition and set-up the
necessary tools and test equipment for the Government to conduct
maintenance on the software baseline?</p>
            <p class="p">c. What is the approximate period of time required to train
Government personnel on required hardware testing, troubleshooting,
and repair procedures and procedures for maintaining the software

          <div class="body conbody">
            <p class="p">In accordance with FAR 15.203, an RFP is used in negotiated
acquisitions to communicate the Government’s requirement(s)
to prospective offerors and to solicit proposals. When developing
the RFP, consider the following:</p>
            <p class="p">1. The RFP should clearly and effectively communicate the
Government’s IP and data rights priorities. Incorporate
delivery requirements and require offerors to assert their specific
restrictions, if any.</p>
            <p class="p">2. Establish a clear understanding of the IP, data deliverables,
and associated license rights requirements.</p>
            <p class="p">3. The required data or software must be a deliverable, assigned
to a CLIN and associated with a CDRL.</p>
            <p class="p">4. Be transparent in articulating IP, data deliverables, and
associated license rights requirements. Also, provide transparency
for requirements related to data for operation, maintenance,
installation, and training (OMIT); modernization; advanced/additive
manufacturing; and sustainment objectives with industry.</p>
            <p class="p">5. Communicate early with industry. Provide
details of the Army’s intended program product
support/sustainment strategy (including sustainment needs and broad
categories of data and/or software required).</p>
            <p class="p">6. Determine whether an offeror has the capability to deliver
license rights for technical data and computer software necessary
for depot level maintenance.</p>
            <p class="p">7. Consistent with 10 U.S.C. §§ 3771-3775, the
contractor or subcontractor is not required to sell or relinquish
to the Government any additional rights in technical data the
Government is not already entitled to as a condition of being
responsive to a solicitation or as a condition of contract award.
However, additional rights conveyed to the Government may be
considered part of a source selection tradeoff.</p>
            <p class="p">8. Once the technical data and/or software required to
complement the maintenance and supply support strategies has been
identified, include solicitation provisions and contract clauses
related to patent, data, and software license rights. Typical
clauses that should be considered for inclusion are:</p>

            <p class="p">(NOTE: Regulations change over time and should be checked
frequently for currency and content. Not all of the listed clauses
above are appropriate together in any particular solicitation or
contract. Other clauses may also be appropriate when there is
development other than exclusively at private expense. Contract
provision and FAR/DFARS clause selection should be modified to fit
each effort. In addition to the standard acquisition attorney
review, an IP attorney should be consulted prior to the release of
any solicitation/contract award involving IP deliverables and
associated license rights.)</p>
            <p class="p">9. Request that offerors propose their own sustainment
transition plan and use it as an evaluation factor (technical sub
factor – Supportability and Maintenance).</p>
            <p class="p">10. For trademark license rights and protection of Government
Program names and model designators consult a Government IP or

            <p class="p">11. Require offerors to submit computer software and data rights
assertions of restrictions in a table consistent with DFARS
252.227-7013, DFARS 252.227-7014, or DFARS 252.227-7017.</p>
            <p class="p">12. Request that offerors propose all cost(s)/price(s) to
acquire additional license and patent rights than the Government is
entitled to and explain any limitations that may be imposed by the
offeror. Include FAR 52.227-6 in solicitation if appropriate and
certifies cost and pricing data is required. (Note: The offeror is
required to identify/disclose any royalty cost(s)/price(s) for
third-party patents proposed to be used in performance of the

process in the DoD Source Selection Procedures, section 3.1.2.2,

applicable to the definitions in DoD SSP Table 2B.</p>
            <p class="p">Data rights cannot be a factor or subfactor. However, offerors
may be granted one or more strengths related to data rights for a
give factor or subfactor. Further, the Government cannot require
the offeror to relinquish its data rights beyond Government’s
statutory entitlement. The Government may not assign a weakness or
deficiency due to a lack of proposed data rights above the minimum
statutory entitlement.</p>
            <p class="p">Strength Examples:</p>
            <p class="p">1) Delivering technical data with license rights that facilitate
future competitive procurement;</p>
            <p class="p">2) Delivering items that are available in the commercial market
that can be procured by other contractors in a future competitive
procurement (even without providing detailed technical information
on these commercially available items); and/or</p>
            <p class="p">3) Delivering a Product Support/Sustainment Strategy that
includes Government purpose rights (licensing technical data to
alternate contractors who will be able to participate in future
competitive procurements).</p>

                <u class="ph u">Evaluation Considerations</u>
              </strong>
            </p>
            <p class="p">When assessing the proposed data rights, consider the
following:</p>

            <p class="p">1. The Government is entitled to an “unlimited rights
license” or an “unrestricted rights license” to
form, fit, and function data; and data necessary for operation,
maintenance, installation, and training, other than Detailed
Manufacturing and Process Data (under DFARS 252.227-7013(b)(1) and
DFARS 252.227-7015(b)(1)). Furthermore, the Government is entitled
to an “unlimited rights” license for studies, analyses,
and test data produced for the contract (when the testing was
specified as an element of performance) that relate to
non-commercial items, components, and processes. Thus, the
Government should review and validate the offeror’s data and
software rights assertions, in coordination with the
program’s attorney advisor, to ensure that the
offeror’s proposal reflects at least the license rights to
which the Government is entitled. (Note: For more detailed
information, refer to the Army Data and Rights Guide <a class="xref" href="http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/cpic/cp/docs/Army_Data_and_Data_Rights_Guide_1st_Edition_4_Aug_2015.pdf" target="_blank">
                <u class="ph u">http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/cpic/cp/docs/Army_Data_and_Data_Rights_Guide_1st_Edition_4_Aug_2015.pdf</u>
              </a>)</p>
            <p class="p">2. Negotiate data rights while still in a competitive
environment. These negotiations will likely require the Contracting
Officer to open discussions unless the solicitation provides
another methodology. Although data rights cannot be a factor or
subfactor, discussions/negotiations can be opened to negotiate any
element of a solicitation or proposal ( see sample language for
Sections L&amp;M to incorporate data rights as a possible strength
in the evaluation). Note: Certain Associated License Rights will be
granted by standard DFARS clauses. Additional Associated License
Rights may be applicable negotiated Special License Agreement or
commercial license agreement. However, the data delivery
requirements must be specified, case-by-case, in each individual
contract, and data deliverables must be clearly identified by CLINs
and CDRLs that are traceable to the PWS. Deferring the discussion
of data deliverables will likely put the Government at a
disadvantage, however, it is an option (see DFARS 252.227-7027
Deferred Ordering of Technical Data or Computer Software). If there
are no data deliverables, the Government cannot exercise its data
rights. The data rights and data deliverables should be negotiated
at the same time. The IP Strategy should continuously be updated to
forecast future sustainment needs so Government can obtain
competitive pricing for future activities.) The negotiated rights
shall be passed down to the subcontractor(s).</p>
            <p class="p">3. Ensure the solicitation requires the proposal to include the
supporting information necessary for the Government to validate
contractor’s ability to provide any proposed data rights. For
example:</p>
            <p class="p">a. The offeror’s proposal shall demonstrate the ability to
grant license rights for technical data and computer software
necessary for depot maintenance, if applicable.</p>
            <p class="p">b. Identify the software developer/owner. Determine if the
offeror wholly owns the rights necessary to make, use, sell, or
offer them for sale. Is there a third party software
developer/owner?</p>
            <p class="p">c. Determine if the offeror proposed third-party and/or utilizes
open source software. Will any of the third-party software be open
source?</p>
            <p class="p">4. With the assistance of a cognizant IP attorney, the
Government should conduct research to verify IP and data rights
assertions made by the offeror. If the Government has reason to
believe that the offeror incorrectly asserted that an item was
developed exclusively at private expense, the Government may audit
the offeror’s accounts with the assistance of the Defense
Contracting Audit Agency (DCAA). (NOTE: The Contracting Officer
should engage with DCAA as early in the process in the procurement
planning process as possible to determine DCAA’s availability
to assist.)</p>

In other words, the size of the prime’s suppliers is determined by the applicable NAICS code of their joint venture, teaming partner, or subcontract, which may or may not be the same NAICS code as the one for your prime contract with the government.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p">An online Reverse Auction (RA) is an internet-based (electronic commerce) acquisition tool that allows the government to procure goods and services from suppliers in a competitive environment in which sellers, anonymously, bid prices down until the auction is complete.</p>
      <p class="p">A reverse auction is simply the opposite of a traditional auction. In a traditional auction, the seller offers an item for sale and multiple potential buyers submit sequentially higher bids for the item. Conversely, in a reverse auction, there are multiple sellers of items that compete for the business of a single buyer. During this competition the sellers ultimately drive the price of the item down.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">G-2</span> Applicability to Best Value Acquisitions</h3>
        <div class="body conbody">
          <p class="p">Online RAs are legal as long as the identity of the bidders is
not disclosed. Online RA tools may be used as a pricing tool for
LPTAs or tradeoff acquisitions. For example, an RA tool can be used
as a pricing tool for a tradeoff acquisition after the completion
of technical discussion. You may conduct a reverse auction to
establish the offerors’ final prices, provide these prices,
along with the rest of the evaluation results, to the SSA for
his/her use in selecting the proposal that represents the best
value.</p>
          <p class="p">Potential benefits are reduced acquisition cycle time and
increased competition that in due course drive prices down as the
offerors have visibility of the other prices being proposed.
Additionally, the online RA process is inclusive, transparent, and
immediately advantageous to both government and industry.</p>
          <p class="p">FAR Subpart 4.5 supports the use of electronic commerce whenever
practical or cost-effective. Online RAs should be utilized when it
is anticipated that this method will deliver more value than the
use of other available procurement methods. Additionally, RAs are
more advantageous to the government in reducing acquisition cycle
time when the requirements are best suited for an RA
environment.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">G-3</span> Process</h3>
        <div class="body conbody">
          <p class="p">Online RAs are conducted using a variety of procedures and
automated tools. An agency may contract with an online auction
service to conduct the reverse auction, or it may conduct the
reverse auction itself using commercially available software.</p>
          <p class="p">In either case, the reverse auction must be conducted on a
secure website, and you must clearly state in the RFP the ground
rules for the auction, particularly when the bidding will start and
stop.</p>
          <p class="p">Effective 29 August 2024, updated FAR language, as cited at FAR
17.802(c )(4) and FAR 17.802(d)(5)(iii) and in turn revised
contract clause FAR 52.217-12 provides new guidance and awareness
to offerors and reverse auction service providers regarding
Government’s access, use and disclosure requirements as well
as the disposition instructions which contracting officers shall
provide in solicitations and resulting awards.</p>
