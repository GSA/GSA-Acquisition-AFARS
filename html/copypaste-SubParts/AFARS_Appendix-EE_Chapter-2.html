      <span class="ph autonumber">2-9.</span> Management of the GPC Program</h2>
      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. The ODASA(P) has overall responsibility for the
management of the Army GPC program. The ODASA(P) appoints a CPM,
also known as the Level 2 A/OPC, to manage the Army GPC program.
The SCO, or in activities that do not have a SCO, the CCO or
equivalent, designates, at a minimum, one Level 3 OA/OPC and an
alternate Level 3 OA/OPC who, once appointed in JAM, is dedicated
to the management of the GPC Program within their
agency/organization. The SCO or CCO may further delegate in writing
the authority to appoint the Level 3 and 4 A/OPCs in accordance
with Army policy. Level 3 A/OPCs with authority to delegate
procurement authority must have the corresponding appointment
letter in JAM to appoint Level 4 A/OPCs. Level 4 A/OPCs may appoint
CHs and billing officials in JAM if they are given the authority to
delegate procurement authority and have the corresponding
appointment letter in JAM. Certifying officers must be appointed by
the organization’s designated DD 577 appointing authority in
JAM.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. The Level 3 OA/OPC duties and responsibilities
at Army major command headquarters typically warrant a grade (or
equivalent thereof) of GS-14, preferably in the contracting career
field. Exceptions may apply. The Level 3 A/OPC duties and
responsibilities for non-headquarter commands typically warrant a
grade of GS-12 to GS-14, preferably in the contracting career
field, but exceptions may apply if approved by the SCO or CCO.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. The Level 4 A/OPC duties and responsibilities
typically warrant a grade (or equivalent thereof) of GS-11 to GS-12
in any career field (e.g., 1101, 1105, or 343) if they meet the
knowledge, skills, and abilities listed below. Exceptions may
apply. The grade should reflect the corresponding complexity of
their duties and responsibilities. The A/OPC will be designated by
the appropriate contracting official to be responsible for the
management, administration, and day-to-day operation of the GPC
program at the activity. Written delegations are required in JAM,
and each A/OPC will be granted the appropriate system access (e.g.,
JAM, bank EAS) associated with their role.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. Level 3 and 4 A/OPCs must complete the training
requirements detailed in Chapter 4. Only individuals who possess
the following knowledge, skills, and abilities may be appointed as
Level 3 and 4 A/OPCs for the GPC Program:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Understanding of the relevant GPC policies,
procedures, and commercial contracting practices.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Understanding of the relevant procurement laws
and regulations.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Understanding of what constitutes an authorized
purchase transaction.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Understanding of procurement methods and
standards.</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) Ability to communicate, organize, and manage
tasks effectively.</p>
        <p class="p List2">6) Basic analytical and computer skills.</p>
        <p class="p List2">7) Ability to summarize data, prepare reports and
write effectively using proper grammar, punctuation, and tone.</p>
        <p class="p List2">8) Ability to analyze, research, and provide
concise recommendations to the chain of command on required actions
to anticipate, prevent, or correct problems in business processes
that are supported by the GPC.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. The Government Charge Card Abuse and Prevention
Act of 2012 requires all Executive Branch agencies to establish and
maintain safeguards and internal controls to prevent waste, fraud,
and abuse of purchase cards. Internal controls are tools to help
program and financial managers achieve results and safeguard the
integrity of their programs. Effective internal controls provide
reasonable assurance that significant risks or weaknesses adversely
impacting the agency's ability to meet its objectives are
prevented, minimized, or are detected in a timely manner. The Level
3 and Level 4 A/OPC will notify the BO or CH of any action taken
due to a BO’s or CH’s non-compliance with Army policies
and procedures.</p>
        <p class="p List1">f. Level 3 and Level 4 A/OPCs have the authority
to apply internal controls such as suspending or cancelling BO or
CH accounts; lowering credit limits; adding or deleting Merchant
Category Codes (MCC); and initiating additional controls as
necessary to comply with GPC policies and procedures.</p>
        <p class="p List1">g. Results of legal reviews are not sufficient
justification for CHs to proceed with a particular purchase. If a
CH or BO is unsure if they can proceed with a questionable
purchase, they should contact the Level 4 A/OPC for guidance and
confirm authority prior to making the purchase.</p>
        <p class="p List1">h. Army agencies and organizations must provide
adequate resources dedicated to the GPC program within their
agency/organization to ensure successful management of the program.
Adequate GPC resources refer to an agency’s efficient and
effective deployment of assets (e.g., span of control, personnel,
training, funding, facilities, and deployment of knowledge and
skills) as needed to comply with the policies, procedures, laws,
and regulations governing the GPC Program. Adequate resources must
be deployed to reasonably ensure that programs achieve their
intended results; resources are used consistently with agency
mission; programs and resources are protected from fraud, waste,
and mismanagement; laws and regulations are followed; and reliable
and timely information is obtained, maintained, and reported for
decision-making.</p>
        <p class="p List1">i. The local contracting office must coordinate
with the local personnel office to ensure procedures are
established requiring all individuals to coordinate with the Level
4 A/OPC when they out-process from the Army command or
activity.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">2-10.</span> Separation of Duties</h2>
      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. Separation of duties is an internal control
activity intended to provide checks and balances to the GPC process
and to prevent or minimize innocent errors or intentional fraud
occurring without detection. This internal control ensures that no
single individual has control over multiple phases of a purchase
card transaction. To protect the integrity of the procurement
process, no one person is responsible for an entire purchase card
transaction. OMB standards for internal controls require that key
duties and responsibilities be divided or segregated among
individuals to ensure they do not exceed or abuse their assigned
authority. See OMB Circular A-123, Appendix B Revised, paragraph
4.3. To the greatest extent possible, GPC duties will be assigned
to different individuals within the GPC hierarchical structure. As
stated in the DoD FMR, “separation of duties precludes errors
or attempts at fraud or embezzlement from going undetected.
Internal controls generally require a four-way separation of the
contracting, receiving/[accepting], voucher certification, and
disbursing functions.”</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. Key GPC duties include making purchases and/or
payments (CHs); verifying purchases and/or payments are proper
(BOs, Certifying Officers, and FSOs); certifying invoices for
payment (BOs, Certifying Officers, and FSOs); certifying
availability of funds (Financial RMs); receiving and accepting
supplies and services, including independent receipt and acceptance
(acceptors); disbursing funds (Disbursing Office); and conducting
policy, review, and audit functions (A/OPCs and Property Book
Officers). For example:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) BOs will not be CHs under their own MAs.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) RMs will not be CHs or BOs with responsibility
for executing their own funds.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Accountable Property Officers or their
equivalents will not be CHs with authority to purchase accountable
items (this does not apply to Property Book Hand Receipt
Holders).</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Purchases of accountable (e.g., pilferable)
property, and self-generated purchases, will have acceptance
performed by someone other than the CH, BO, and Certifying
Officer.</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) CAC-enabled systems will generate a
conflict-of-interest report to depict instances where assigned
roles do not conform to DoD policy.</p>
        <p class="p List2">6) Authorization roles will be assigned to a
user’s profile, with each profile allowing only that
individual the ability to perform specific tasks in the system.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. If resource constraints prevent assignment of
the key duties to different individuals, as set forth in paragraph
a. above, the activity must request a waiver through the Level 4
A/OPC and the CCO to the Level 3 A/OPC for approval.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. Notwithstanding the above-described waiver
process, certain key duties must not be assigned to the same
individual. In no case will the same individual be both the CH and
BO for a GPC account. In no case will the Accountable Property
Officer or A/OPC (primary or alternate) also be a CH, BO or
contracting officer making contract payments with a GPC or
executing GPC purchases. A CH who is a hand receipt holder should
not purchase property for their own use. The servicing bank
provides the functionality to generate a report identifying
potential conflicts of interest in GPC program duties.</p>

      <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title12">
      <span class="ph autonumber">2-11.</span> Span of Control</h2>
      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. Span of control refers to the extent of
oversight and review responsibilities placed on a single A/OPC, BO,
or CH. An appropriate span of control must efficiently and
effectively allow the A/OPC, BO, or CH to provide reasonable
assurance they can effectively perform their responsibilities
regardless of the number of accounts assigned. The assigned span of
control must factor in the monitoring and oversight
responsibilities to include the use of MasterCard’s Insights
on Demand (IOD) data mining and review process. To ensure GPC
program participants have sufficient time to complete required
reviews, GPC programs will abide by established span-of-control
limits. The following span-of-control internal controls have been
established for the Army GPC Program:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) The number of CH accounts (not individual
cardholders) assigned to a primary BO will not exceed seven.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) An individual may not be assigned more than
three CH accounts.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) An A/OPC will not be responsible for more than
250 GPC accounts (card accounts and MAs combined). This ratio will
be reevaluated biennially.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Primary A/OPC vacancies must be filled in a
timely manner to prevent excessively burdening Alternate A/OPCs
over an extended time.</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) The CPM has authority to approve deviation from
the ratios in 1) through 3) above on a case-by-case basis provided
the organization establishes sufficient local oversight and
compensating controls. Deviation approval is a CPM responsibility
and cannot be delegated.</p>
        <p class="p List2">6) For the ratios in 1) through 3) above,
compensating controls include, at a minimum, briefing the HA on the
deviation(s) and any related ramifications, during all subsequent
Semi-annual Head of Activity Review (SAHAR) briefing(s) in which
the deviation(s) remain in place.</p>
        <p class="p List2">7) For the ratio in item 2) above, as the SAHAR
does not report on the number of CH accounts assigned to an
individual, other compensating controls would need to be in place
for any deviation(s) the CPM approves. Any deviations must be
reported to the HA through the SAHAR process and annotated in the
Notes section of the SAHAR report.</p>
        <p class="p List2">8) When Army policy authorizes use of the GPC for
more complex transactions (e.g., by Ordering Officials), the Army
should institute more stringent span-of-control ratios as
appropriate.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. A/OPCs should use PIEE/JAM or the card-issuing
bank’s EAS to provide appropriate management notification and
reports on various spans of control. All Common Access Card
(CAC)-enabled systems supporting or using GPC data should utilize
functions to define and manage all hierarchies assigned within the
system—not just the GPC organizational hierarchy.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. An individual may not be assigned more than one
CH account for each special designation in their appointment.
Assignment of roles includes effective from/to dates. This includes
personnel assignment to an A/OPC, BO, or CH, as well as the
relationships of the BO to the A/OPC and the CH to the BO.
Management oversight reports should be defined to report personnel,
position, and relationship assignments.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. The card-issuing bank’s EAS report on
span of control based on user ID cannot be used as an irrefutable
source to support span-of-control limits, since an individual may
have more than one bank user ID. A/OPCs must track all roles an
individual has been provisioned/assigned using their unique CAC
public-key infrastructure or other unique identifier that may be
implemented by the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and
Readiness.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. The Army standard for span of control for a
Level 4 A/OPC is 250 BO and CH accounts per Level 4 A/OPC. This
total includes both the BO and CH accounts added together. Span of
control updates are deemed necessary due to changing program
dynamics and increased oversight burdens placed on GPC oversight
personnel over time. As the micro-purchase threshold has increased
multiple times over the years, additional oversight has been
required by GPC personnel as the average dollar value and the types
and complexity of the GPC supplies and services being purchased has
increased.</p>
        <p class="p List1">f. The total number of transactions, as well as
the number of assigned card accounts, must be considered when
determining an acceptable card account to BO ratio. When the number
of accounts or workload complexity/administration assigned to a
Level 4 A/OPC exceeds the Army standard, the SCO/CCO must ensure
adequate resources are made available to allow the A/OPC to
successfully perform their duties. When the span of control exceeds
the Army standard and the CCO elects not to provide additional
resources, the CCO must submit a waiver request in writing to the
CPM for approval. The waiver request must include the rationale and
justification upon which the CCO has based the determination that
the existing span of control is adequate to ensure program
administration and that surveillance can be performed at a
satisfactory level given the existing or new compensatory controls
put in place. The Level 3 A/OPC must retain a copy of this
documentation.</p>
        <p class="p List1">g. The Level 4 A/OPC determines whether the BO to
CH ratio is acceptable upon issuance of a GPC, during the
A/OPC’s annual assessment of their GPC program, or as needed.
There must be a reasonable expectation that the BO can complete a
thorough review of all transactions and certify the invoice within
five business days of its receipt. When the ratio for CH accounts
to BO exceeds the Army standard, the BO should lower the number of
card accounts or request a waiver to policy. The Level 4 A/OPC will
document all cases where the CH to BO ratio exceeds the Army
standard. The waiver to policy request must address the unique
conditions that affect the process and show, with a high degree of
certainty, that the BO can be expected to comply with the review
and certification procedures. The request must include the number
and location of assigned CHs, the total average number of
transactions made by the CHs, the amount of time the BO can devote
to the certification process, the history of delinquencies, and
other appropriate factors. The waiver is approved at the following
levels indicated below and maintained by the approver with copies
furnished to the BO:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) 8–10 card accounts. Routed through the
Level 4 A/OPC to the CCO.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) 11–19 card accounts. Routed through the
