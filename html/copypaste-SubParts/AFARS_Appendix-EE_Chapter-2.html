    <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">The GPC Program is founded on a six-tiered hierarchal reporting chain
            of command system identified in Figures 2-1 and 2-2. The formal
            names associated with specific roles within this hierarchy are often
            used interchangeably with the corresponding level of authority
            within the hierarchy. For instance, A/OPCs may be referred to as
            Level 4s, and the Army GPC CPM is often referred to as the Level 2.
            Table 2-1 describes the GPC roles in PIEE and JAM.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">2-9.</span> Management of the GPC Program</h2>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. The OUSD DPC Level 1 A/OPC interprets and tailors federal statutory and
regulatory laws and guidance for DoD usage, develops business rules common to
all DoD corporate card programs (purchase, travel, air, fleet, and fuel), and
codifies them in the DoD Charge Card Guidebook.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. The ODASA(P) has overall responsibility for the management of the Army GPC
program. The ODASA(P) appoints a CPM, also known as the Level 2 A/OPC, to manage
the Army GPC program. The SCO, or in activities that do not have a SCO, the CCO
or equivalent, designates, at a minimum, one Level 3 OA/OPC and an alternate
Level 3 OA/OPC who, once appointed in JAM, is dedicated to the management of the
GPC Program within their agency/organization. The SCO or CCO may further
delegate in writing the authority to appoint the Level 3 and 4 A/OPCs in
accordance with Army policy. Level 3 A/OPCs with authority to delegate
procurement authority must have the corresponding appointment letter in JAM to
appoint Level 4 A/OPCs. Level 4 A/OPCs may appoint CHs and billing officials in
JAM if they are given the authority to delegate procurement authority and have
the corresponding appointment letter in JAM. Certifying officers must be
appointed by the organization’s designated DD 577 appointing authority in
JAM.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. The Level 3 OA/OPC duties and responsibilities at Army major command
headquarters typically warrant a grade (or equivalent thereof) of GS-14,
preferably in the contracting career field, but exceptions may apply if approved
by the SCO or CCO. The Level 3 A/OPC duties and responsibilities for
non-headquarter commands typically warrant a grade of GS-12 to GS-14, preferably
in the contracting career field, but exceptions may apply if approved by the SCO
or CCO.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. The Level 4 A/OPC duties and responsibilities typically warrant a grade
(or equivalent thereof) of GS-11 to GS-12 in any career field (e.g., 1101, 1105,
or 343) as long as they meet the knowledge, skills, and abilities listed below.
The A/OPC will be designated by the appropriate contracting official to be
responsible for the management, administration, and day-to-day operation of the
GPC program at the activity. Written delegations are required in JAM, and each
A/OPC will be granted the appropriate system access (e.g., JAM, bank EAS)
associated with their role. Level 3 and 4 A/OPCs must complete the training
requirements detailed in Chapter 4. Only individuals who possess the following
knowledge, skills, and abilities may be appointed as Level 3 and 4 A/OPCs for
the GPC Program:</p>
      <p class="p">1) Understanding of the relevant GPC policies, procedures, and commercial
contracting practices.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Understanding of the relevant procurement laws and regulations.</p>
      <p class="p">3) Understanding of what constitutes an authorized purchase transaction.</p>
      <p class="p">4) Understanding of procurement methods and standards.</p>
      <p class="p">5) Ability to communicate, organize, and manage tasks effectively.</p>
      <p class="p">6) Basic analytical and computer skills.</p>
      <p class="p">7) Ability to summarize data, prepare reports and write effectively using
proper grammar, punctuation, and tone.</p>
      <p class="p">8) Ability to analyze, research, and provide concise recommendations to the
chain of command on required actions to anticipate, prevent, or correct problems
in business processes that are supported by the GPC.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. The Government Charge Card Abuse and Prevention Act of 2012 requires all
Executive Branch agencies to establish and maintain safeguards and internal
controls to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse of purchase cards. Internal controls
are tools to help program and financial managers achieve results and safeguard
the integrity of their programs. Effective internal controls provide reasonable
assurance that significant risks or weaknesses adversely impacting the agency's
ability to meet its objectives are prevented, minimized, or are detected in a
timely manner. The Level 3 and Level 4 A/OPC will notify the BO or CH of any
action taken due to a BO’s or CH’s non-compliance with Army policies and
procedures.</p>
      <p class="p List1">f. Level 3 and Level 4 A/OPCs have the authority to apply internal controls
such as suspending or cancelling BO or CH accounts; lowering credit limits;
adding or deleting Merchant Category Codes (MCC); and initiating additional
controls as necessary to comply with GPC policies and procedures.</p>
      <p class="p List1">g. Results of legal reviews are not sufficient justification for CHs to
proceed with a particular purchase. If a CH or BO is unsure if they can proceed
with a questionable purchase, they should contact the Level 4 A/OPC for guidance
and confirm authority prior to making the purchase.</p>
      <p class="p List1">h. Army agencies and organizations must provide adequate resources dedicated
to the GPC program within their agency/organization to ensure successful
management of the program. Adequate GPC resources refer to an agency’s efficient
and effective deployment of assets (e.g., span of control, personnel, training,
funding, facilities, and deployment of knowledge and skills) as needed to comply
with the policies, procedures, laws, and regulations governing the GPC Program.
Adequate resources must be deployed to reasonably ensure that programs achieve
their intended results; resources are used consistently with agency mission;
programs and resources are protected from fraud, waste, and mismanagement; laws
and regulations are followed; and reliable and timely information is obtained,
maintained, and reported for decision-making.</p>
      <p class="p List1">i. The local contracting offices must coordinate with the local personnel
office to ensure procedures are established requiring all individuals to
coordinate with the Level 4 A/OPC when they out-process from the
installation.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. OMB standards for internal controls require that key duties and
responsibilities be divided or segregated among individuals to ensure they do
not exceed or abuse their assigned authority. See OMB Circular A-123, Appendix B
Revised, paragraph 4.3. Separation of duties is an internal control activity
intended to provide checks and balances to the GPC process and to prevent or
minimize innocent errors or intentional fraud occurring without detection. This
internal control ensures that no single individual has control over multiple
phases of a purchase card transaction. To protect the integrity of the
procurement process, no one person is responsible for an entire purchase card
transaction. Key purchase card functions must be handled by different
individuals. Inadequate separation of duties could allow errors and fraud to
occur without detection. Key duties, such as making purchases (CH), authorizing
payments (BO), certifying funding (RM), and reviewing transactions (Level 4
A/OPCs and APOs) must be assigned to different individuals to minimize the risk
of loss to the Government to the greatest extent possible.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. If resource constraints prevent assignment of the key duties to different
individuals, as set forth in paragraph a. above, the activity must request a
waiver through the Level 4 A/OPC and the CCO to the Level 3 A/OPC for
approval.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. Notwithstanding the above-described waiver process, certain key duties
must not be assigned to the same individual. In no case will the same individual
be the CH and the BO for a GPC account. In no case will the Accountable Property
Officer or any A/OPC (primary or alternate) also be a CH, BO or contracting
officer who is making contract payments with a GPC or executing GPC purchases. A
CH who is a hand receipt holder should not purchase property for their own use.
The servicing bank provides the functionality to generate a report identifying
potential conflicts of interest in GPC program duties.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. Span of control refers to the extent of oversight and review
responsibilities placed on a single A/OPC, BO, or CH. An appropriate span of
control must efficiently and effectively allow the A/OPC, BO, or CH to provide
reasonable assurance they can effectively perform their responsibilities
regardless of the number of accounts assigned. The assigned span of control must
factor in the monitoring and oversight responsibilities to include the use of
MasterCard’s Insights on Demand (IOD) data mining and review process.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. The Army standard for span of control for a Level 4 A/OPC will not be more
than 250 total accounts to one Level 4 A/OPC. This number includes both BO and
CH accounts. Span of control updates are deemed necessary due to changing
program dynamics and increased oversight burdens placed on GPC oversight
personnel over time. As the micro-purchase threshold has increased multiple
times over the years, additional oversight has been required as the average
dollar value and the types and complexity of the GPC supplies and services being
purchased has increased. A/OPCs and other GPC oversight officials have also been
required to fulfill additional duties related to statutory and regulatory DoD
Charge Card Guidebook, FAR, and DFARS requirements, including complying with
Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 NDAA Section 889(a)(1) requirements. These dynamics
warranted a reduction in the number of GPC accounts an A/OPC is authorized to
oversee, and the flexibility for Component Program Managers to deviate from
updated span of control ratios when sufficient compensating controls are in
place.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. A ratio of not more than seven card accounts to a primary BO is the Army
standard. Ensuring a reasonable number of card accounts are assigned to each
primary BO is paramount to the effective accomplishment of the BO’s
responsibilities. The total number of transactions, as well as the number of
assigned card accounts, must be considered when determining an acceptable card
account to BO ratio.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. When the number of accounts (250:1 account per A/OPC) or workload
complexity/administration assigned to a Level 4 A/OPC exceeds the Army standard,
the SCO and the CCO must ensure adequate resources are made available to allow
the A/OPCs to successfully perform their duties. When the span of control
exceeds the Army standard and the CCO elects not to provide additional
resources, the CCO must submit a waiver request in writing to the CPM for
approval. The waiver request must include the rationale and justification upon
which the CCO has based the determination that the existing span of control is
adequate to ensure program administration and that surveillance can be performed
at a satisfactory level given the existing or new compensatory controls put in
place. The Level 3 A/OPC must retain a copy of this documentation.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. The Level 4 A/OPC determines whether the BO to CH ratio is acceptable upon
issuance of a GPC, during the A/OPC’s annual assessment of their GPC program, or
as needed. There must be a reasonable expectation that the BO can complete a
thorough review of all transactions and certify the invoice within five business
days of its receipt. When the ratio for CH accounts to BO exceeds the Army
standard, the BO should lower the number of card accounts or request a waiver to
policy. The Level 4 A/OPC will document all cases where the CH to BO ratio
exceeds the Army standard. The waiver to policy request must address the unique
conditions that affect the process and show, with a high degree of certainty,
that the BO can be expected to comply with the review and certification
procedures. The request must include the number and location of assigned CHs,
the total average number of transactions made by the CHs, the amount of time the
BO can devote to the certification process, the history of delinquencies, and
other appropriate factors. The waiver is approved at the following levels
indicated below and maintained by the approver with copies furnished to the
BO:</p>
      <p class="p">1) 8–10 card accounts. Routed through the Level 4 A/OPC to the CCO.</p>
      <p class="p">2) 11–19 card accounts. Routed through the A/OPCs (Level 4 and Level 3) to
the SCO.</p>
      <p class="p">3) 20 or more card accounts. Routed through the A/OPCs (Level 4 and Level 3)
to the Level 2.</p>
