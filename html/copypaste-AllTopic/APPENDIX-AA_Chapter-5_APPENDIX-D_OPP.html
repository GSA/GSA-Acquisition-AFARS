      <p class="p" id="AFARS_APPENDIX-AA_Chapter-5_APPENDIX-D_OPP__WGBrIj">Oral presentations provide offerors an opportunity to substitute or augment written information. You can conduct oral presentations in person or via video teleconference. Pre-recorded videotaped presentations do not constitute an oral presentation since it does not represent a real-time exchange of information. However, they may be included in offeror submissions, when appropriate.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_APPENDIX-AA_Chapter-5_APPENDIX-D_OPP__pmGzcF">Oral presentations may be beneficial in a variety of acquisitions. They are most useful when the requirements are clear and complete and are stated in performance or functional terms. Oral presentations are ideal for gathering information related to how qualified the offeror is to perform the work, how well the offeror understands the work, and how the offeror will approach the work.</p>

      </p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_APPENDIX-AA_Chapter-5_APPENDIX-D_OPP__xOzpSK">Before you can decide if oral presentations are appropriate for a given acquisition, you must select the evaluation factors and subfactors. Then decide whether the information you need to evaluate these criteria can be better presented orally or in writing or through a combination of both means.</p>
      <p class="p Text Body" id="AFARS_APPENDIX-AA_Chapter-5_APPENDIX-D_OPP__SyGpKc">You cannot incorporate oral statements in the contract by reference, so any information you want to be made part of the contract needs to be submitted in writing. At a minimum, the offeror must submit certifications, representations, and a signed offer sheet (including any exceptions to the Government’s terms and conditions) in writing. Additionally, as a rule of thumb, the offeror must submit other hard data ("facts"), such as pricing or costing data and contractual commitments, as part of the written proposal.</p>
      <p class="p" id="AFARS_APPENDIX-AA_Chapter-5_APPENDIX-D_OPP__XsCHsn">Oral presentations can convey information in such diverse areas as responses to sample tasks, understanding the requirements, experience, and relevancy of past performance.</p>

Discourage elaborate presentations since they may detract from the information being presented. At a minimum, include the following information in the RFP:</p>

      </p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_APPENDIX-AA_Chapter-5_APPENDIX-D_OPP__p__Hlt507921188">You can conduct oral presentations either before or after establishing the competitive range. Where oral presentations are the only means of proposal submission, they must be presented by all offerors. If you conduct the oral presentations prior to establishing the competitive range, you must be careful they do not result in discussions.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_APPENDIX-AA_Chapter-5_APPENDIX-D_OPP__ytXTtv">Since preparing and presenting an oral presentation involves time and expense, you do not want to require offerors who are not likely to be serious candidates for award to have to conduct oral presentations. This can be an important consideration with small businesses. When this is a concern, establish the competitive range prior to oral presentations and clearly articulate in the RFP the methodology for doing so.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_APPENDIX-AA_Chapter-5_APPENDIX-D_OPP__FsFarQ">The PCO will often draw lots to determine the sequence of the offerors’ presentations. The time between the first and the last presentation should be as short as possible to minimize any advantage to the offerors that present later.</p>

      </p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_APPENDIX-AA_Chapter-5_APPENDIX-D_OPP__iOZoiY">Establish a total time limit for each offeror’s presentation. It is not advisable to limit the time for individual topics or sections within the presentation; this detail is the presenter’s responsibility. If you are planning a question and answer session, exclude it from the allotted time and set a separate time limit for it.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_APPENDIX-AA_Chapter-5_APPENDIX-D_OPP__VwVBXJ">There is no ideal amount of time to be allotted. Make this decision using prudent business judgment based upon the complexity of the acquisition and your own (or others’) experience and lessons learned.</p>

      <p class="p" id="AFARS_APPENDIX-AA_Chapter-5_APPENDIX-D_OPP__yWPVWn">Usually you will want to conduct the presentations at a facility you can control. This helps guard against surprises and ensures a more level playing field. However, nothing precludes you from conducting an oral presentation at an offeror's facility. This may be more efficient if site visits or other demonstrations are part of the source selection process.</p>
      <p class="p" id="AFARS_APPENDIX-AA_Chapter-5_APPENDIX-D_OPP__nwWxzo">If you are using a Government-controlled facility, make it available for inspection and, if warranted, a practice session. Allowing offerors to get acquainted with the facility will help ensure that it does not detract from the presentation content.</p>

      <p class="p" id="AFARS_APPENDIX-AA_Chapter-5_APPENDIX-D_OPP__fuxkmqp">Having an exact record of the presentation could prove useful both during the evaluation process and in the event of a protest or litigation. You can record the oral presentations using a variety of media; e.g., videotapes, audio tapes, written transcripts, or a copy of the offeror’s briefing slides or presentation notes. The SSA is responsible for determining the method and level of detail of the record.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_APPENDIX-AA_Chapter-5_APPENDIX-D_OPP__FjXZje">If you use videotaping, allow for the natural behavior of the presenters. If slides or view graphs are used, the camera should view both the podium and screen at the same time. Place the microphones so that all communications can be recorded clearly and at adequate volume. Every effort should be made to avoid letting the recording become the focus of the presentation.</p>
      <p class="p" id="AFARS_APPENDIX-AA_Chapter-5_APPENDIX-D_OPP__IWCqqS">The recording, which is considered source selection information, will become part of the official record. Provide a copy to the offeror and seal and securely store the master copy of the recording to ensure there are no allegations of tampering in the event of a protest or court action.</p>

Key personnel include project managers, task leaders, and other in-house staff of the offeror’s, or their prospective key subcontractors’ organizations. This will avoid the oral presentation becoming the domain of a professional presenter, which would increase costs, detract from the advantages of oral presentations, and adversely affect small businesses.</p>

This includes discussing any restrictions on Government-Offeror information exchanges, information disclosure rules, documentation requirements, and housekeeping items. These ground rules should also be included in the RFP.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_APPENDIX-AA_Chapter-5_APPENDIX-D_OPP__sYKRFY">If you are using a quiz as part of your evaluation, the PCO needs to discuss the related ground rules. For example, can the offeror caucus or contact outside sources by cell phone before answering?</p>
      <p class="p" id="AFARS_APPENDIX-AA_Chapter-5_APPENDIX-D_OPP__p__Hlt498145458">Avoid too much control and regulation since it will inhibit the exchange of information. However, if you intend to avoid discussions, the PCO should control all exchanges during the presentation. If conducting oral presentations after opening discussions, you must comply with FAR 15.306 and 15.307.</p>
