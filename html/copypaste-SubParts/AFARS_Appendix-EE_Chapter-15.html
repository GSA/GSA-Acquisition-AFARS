      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. The GPC may be used as a payment method on
contracts. See FAR 32.1108. The Contracting Officer will make the
determination to use the GPC as the payment method for CHs to make
contract payments on formal contract vehicles up to the limit of
the Contracting Officer’s warrant when the GPC payment method
is proven to be more advantageous to the Government. Benefits to
increasing GPC contract payments include greatly increased refunds
per effort expended, exemption from GPC data mining, and faster
receipt of payments. Contracting Officers normally appoint CHs
residing in the contracting office as GPC contract payment CHs. The
Contracting Officer or an A/OPC with the appropriate delegating
authority may appoint GPC contract payment CHs outside the
contracting office providing the Contracting Officer or A/OPC with
the appropriate delegating authority provides adequate training and
oversight.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. All modifications impacting payment and/or
funding (including options exercised) must be re-coordinated with
the RM, CH, and BO to ensure the financial management system and
the bank’s EAS are properly updated. Failure to do so will
result in the servicing bank not being paid which may result in a
possible account delinquency. The CH will maintain supporting
documentation in the bank’s EAS for each contract payment
made using the GPC.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. At a minimum, procedures must be in place to
ensure proper separation of duties to safeguard Government
resources and to avoid the posting of double obligations associated
with the use of the GPC to make payment on existing contract
vehicles. Contracts where the GPC is used as the method of payment
are required to be fully funded. No progress (finance) payments are
authorized.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">FPDS-NG</strong>. Contracting Officers
are responsible for ensuring the FPDS reporting is completed. When
the GPC is used as a method of payment against a contract, the
action must be reported in an individual contract action report
(CAR), and “Yes” must be selected for “Purchase
Card as Payment Method” in FPDS. See FPDS reporting
requirements of FAR 4.6, DFARS 204.6, and DFARS PGI 204.606.
Open-market micro-purchases made with the GPC and valued less than
the MPT will not be reported to FPDS. (See FAR 4.606(c) for a list
of additional actions that are not to be reported.)</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. FAR policy requires the consent of contractors
when contemplating the use of GPC as the payment method. Consent is
typically obtained by including FAR clause 52.232-36 in the
solicitation and, if the contractor does not object, the contract.
Existing contracts may be modified to include the clause, with the
consent of the contractor. The GPC may be used as a contract
payment method if the vendor accepts the payment.</p>
        <p class="p List1">f. <strong class="ph b">Contract Payment Processes</strong>.
The servicing bank has two different methods for contract payments:
a payment card process and a Payment Plus process. See paragraph
15-4 and Figure 15-1 for a description of the payment card process.
See paragraph 15-5 and Figure 15-2 for a description of the Payment
Plus process.</p>

      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">FAR 32.1108 and 32.1110(d) provide instructions for use of the
appropriate clause when payment under a written contract is made by
GPC. When using the GPC for contract payments, the contracting
officer</p>
        <p class="p">will insert the FAR clause 52.232-36, Payment by Third Party, in
solicitations and contracts. Payment by a purchase card may also be
made under a contract that does not contain the clause at
52.232-36, to the extent the contractor agrees to accept that
method of payment. When the clause at 52.232-36 is included in a
solicitation or contract, the contracting officer will also insert
the clause at 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds
Transfer—Central Contractor Registration, or 52.232-34,
Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer—Other Than Central
Contractor Registration, as appropriate. The contracting officer
should also insert DFARS clause 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission
of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports.</p>

GPC that is embossed and established for only “Contract

Validation Control (AVC) “EDI CP GFEBS.” Cardholder
creates a manual purchase order for each contract. Cardholder
provides the same card information to the contractor as they would
for a purchase to the merchant. The person within the agency
responsible for the payments is the BO who will certify the invoice
“transaction(s)” for payment to the bank.</p>

      <p class="p List1">b. The Contracting Officer is responsible for
ensuring the WAWF clauses are included in the contract, the vendor
initiates the receiving report in WAWF, and the Government acceptor
documents acceptance in WAWF. The CH is required to verify
acceptance has occurred in WAWF prior to approving his/her billing
statement and sending it to the BO for approval and Certifying

          </strong> specify the GPC as the method of payment when
contract administration functions will be performed by other than
the contracting organization (e.g., they will be assigned to DCMA),
because the contract administration office does not have insight
into contract delivery and payments. To ensure proper routing of
contracts paid with the GPC, contracts assigned to DCMA for
administration cannot cite the GPC as the method of payment. <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/dfarspgi/pgi-part-242-contract-administration#DFARS_PGI_PGI_242.002" target="_blank">DFARS

Process</h2>
      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. Wide Area Workflow must be utilized when making
contract payments with the GPC per DFARS 232.7002, 232.7003, and
252.232-7003. The contractor must use WAWF to create the purchase
card receiving report (PCRR) when the GPC is used as a method of
payment. The CH provides the following information to the
contractor to submit PCRR into WAWF:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Vendor Identifier: Vendor/Company Name</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Payment Office: CRCARD</p>

        <p class="p List2">6) Card Issuing Bank ID: 556862</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. The contractor then uses WAWF to create and
submit the PCRR. Upon notification that the goods have been
received, the Government acceptor accepts the PCRR in WAWF. The CH
verifies that acceptance has occurred in PIEE/WAWF and that the
contracting officer has approved the invoice. The CH submits the
invoice, receiving report, copy of the contract and modifications,
and a current obligation/disbursement sheet to the BO for approval.
After acceptance of the property in WAWF, data will flow to the
Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) based on the Pay
DoDAAC<em class="ph i">.</em> Indicating “CRCARD” as the payment
office prevents double obligation and data from entering the
payment process.</p>
