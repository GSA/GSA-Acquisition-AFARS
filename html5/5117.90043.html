         the value of non-pre-priced work under an order must not exceed 10 percent of the value of
         the pre-priced work.</p>
      <p class="p Revised August 4, 2022file:/home/ec2-user/ditatool/tce/AFARS/AFARS_Fixed/dita/5117.90043.ditap:7;25:59 List3">(i) The value of the pre-priced work must

         costs and profit for non-pre-priced work may be attributed by the application of a
         solicited and pre-agreed rate to be applied to the unburdened labor, equipment, and
         material costs of the non-pre-priced work.</p>

         must not be manipulated or forced to fit under a pre-priced line item, either to avoid
         including non-pre-priced line items in the order or to reduce the value of non-pre-priced
         line items in an attempt to circumvent the limitation in (c)(2).</p>

         non-pre-priced work exceeds 10 percent, then the non-pre-priced work should be reduced,
         eliminated, performed in-house, or the job must be acquired using other contracting
         methods. However, contracting officers may exceed the 10 percent if justified and approved
         in accordance with FAR 6.302. The contracting officer shall negotiate the modification and
         make a determination that the price is fair and reasonable.</p>
