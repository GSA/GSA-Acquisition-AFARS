      <p id="gqlmpI" outputclass="Normal">These procedures apply to all GPC purchases with cards issued by the Army. Non-Army tenant organizations issued Army GPCs or convenience checks by an Army contracting office are also subject to these procedures. All BOs, CHs, A/OPCs (at all levels), Resource Managers (RMs), Logisticians, and other stakeholders that participate in the GSA SmartPay Purchase Card Program under the Army Level 2 hierarchy are subject to these procedures. The policy established in this document supersedes previous guidance issued in the Draft Army Regulation (AR715-xx). Explanation of the Army level hierarchy is provided at 1-8.</p>
