      <span class="ph autonumber">6-1.</span> Procurement Transactions</h2>
      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. Purchases below the MPT are exempt from the
Competition in Contracting Act, Buy American Act, Economy Act,
Service Contract Labor Standards Act, Wage Rates Requirements Act,
and the Small Business Set-Aside Program. Nothing in this chapter
exempts a cardholder from using the proper contracting channels
when making purchases exceeding the MPT.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. Requiring activities must perform acquisition
planning to identify procurement needs; consider strategic sourcing
vehicles (e.g., BPAs, CHESS, GSA); and initiate procurement actions
with sufficient lead time to buy appropriate products at the right
price from the right suppliers in a timely manner. Requirements and
logistics personnel should avoid issuing requirements on an urgent
basis or with unrealistic delivery or performance schedules, since
it generally restricts competition and increases prices. Ordering
from existing contracts (e.g., BPAs, CHESS, or GSA FSS) can only be
done by an appointed ordering official, including purchases below
the MPT.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. Purchase requirements exceeding the MPTs, or
delegations of authority established in Tables 1-2 and 1-3 must be
referred to a contracting office. Splitting requirements into
smaller parts to avoid formal contracting procedures, competition
requirements, or to keep spending limitations under the MPT is
prohibited. The GPC may be used for non-personal recurring services
performed at regular intervals up the MPT. Recurring service
requirements estimated to exceed the MPT per FY must be directed to
the contracting office. There is no single source that states
contracts must be put in place for a recurring supply requirement
costing $10k or less per 12-month period. The contracting office
will determine if recurring supplies should be placed on a contract
or BPA.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. Cardholders must use the mandatory sources
identified in Chapter 9 before deciding to use commercial sources.
GPC micro-purchases should be distributed equitably among qualified
suppliers, with special consideration paid to supporting the
installation AbilityOne Base Supply Center, and local, small, and
small disadvantaged businesses.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. Cardholders are responsible for procuring green
products and services under the Green Procurement Program as
prescribed by Executive Order 13834 and by DoD and Army policies.
Green procurement applies to the purchase of recovered materials,
energy and water efficient products, alternative fuels and fuel
efficiency, bio-based products, non-ozone depleting substances,
environmentally preferable products and services, and toxic and
hazardous chemicals. The following are mandatory Green Procurement
purchases: paper, toner, office products, office recycle
containers, and office trash cans. The following are the only
exceptions to purchasing green products and services: the pricing
is considered unreasonable; item/service does not meet reasonable
standards; or item/service will not meet the time frame needed.
Exceptions must be documented. Recommended sources for green
products are AbilityOne, FedMall, and GSA Advantage.</p>
        <p class="p List1">f. <strong class="ph b">OCONUS Units</strong>. For the use of
the GPC outside the U.S., CHs must follow policy in accordance with
DFARS 213.301(2). To ensure the CH does not exceed $25,000 for
OCONUS purchases, the total purchase price must include the
currency conversion rate prior to making the purchase. If a CH
makes a purchase from an OCONUS location for use OCONUS and the
vendor location is CONUS, this would be considered a reach-back
purchase and the MPT for a reach-back purchase is $10,000. Any
reach- back purchase over $10,000 is subject to simplified
acquisition procedures and should be sent to the contracting office
for action.</p>
        <p class="p List1">g. For purchases made in the Contiguous United
States (CONUS) for use overseas, the CH must contact their local
Director of Logistics Traffic Management Office for assistance
regarding transportation and packaging requirements and/or
instructions prior to contacting the vendor. CHs must ensure the
final price includes all costs associated with the mode of
transportation and packaging selected to the destination country,
customs import duties, and any other charges that may accrue. See
DoD Directive 4500.54-E, DoD Foreign Clearance Program for
compliance with host nation customs requirements.</p>
        <p class="p List1">h. <strong class="ph b">OCONUS Value-Added Tax (VAT)
Forms</strong>. The cost of the VAT can be charged on the GPC.
Cardholders must contact their A/OPC for local guidance and
procedures involving the use of the VAT form. To obtain a copy of
the form, CHs may contact the local Morale, Welfare and Recreation
(MWR) office.</p>
        <p class="p List1">i. <strong class="ph b">Terms and Conditions</strong>. Neither
cardholders nor billing officials have the authority to approve or
sign written vendor terms and conditions. Cardholders will consult
their A/OPC, contracting office, and/or local legal office for
additional guidance.</p>
        <p class="p List1">j. <strong class="ph b">Convenience Check Accounts</strong>.
The management controls, procedures, and restrictions included in
this regulation also apply to the use of convenience checking
accounts. Convenience checks are an alternative only when the GPC
is not feasible and the activity has evaluated all alternatives and
determined the checks as the most advantageous. Before a check is
issued, the requiring organization must document their effort to
find a merchant that accepts the GPC. Convenience checks must not
be used for more than one half of the MPT per Public Law 115-91.
Checkwriters who write checks over the convenience check MPT (see
Table 1-2) will have their convenience check account terminated.
See Chapter 10.</p>

      <p class="p List1">a. Personnel requiring supplies/services must
provide written requests to the CH. Upon receipt of a purchase
request, the CH should identify if the requirement can be made
within the scope of the GPC program. Cardholders must ensure the
requirement is a legitimate government need and determine if the
requirement can be met within their credit limits.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. The BO must verify availability of funds at the
time of each purchase. No Government employee may create or
authorize an obligation in excess of available funds or in advance
of appropriations.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. Only the CH is authorized to make the purchase
- no exceptions. CHs cannot re-delegate their authority. Purchases
can be made in person or by telephone, internet, or email.
Cardholders must maintain card security throughout the buying
process. Invoices must be in English.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Shipping</strong>. CHs are unauthorized
to ship to personal residences or other commercial addresses
without approval from Level 3 A/OPC. For OCONUS purchases, CHs
should coordinate with their local logistics office to determine
whether commercial shipment is available for purchases outside the
U.S. If it is not, ensure the vendor is provided with the necessary
information to allow the purchase to enter the Defense
Transportation System (DTS), which requires that the shipment has a
Military Shipping Label (MSL) that includes a Transportation
Control Number, Final Destination (in country) address and DoD
Activity Address Code (DoDAAC), Priority, Required Delivery Date,
and Transportation Accounting Code. <span class="ph" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_6-2__Toc64815327"></span>
        </p>
      <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Precautions to Avoid Frustrated
Freight</strong>. A supplier shipment that becomes
“frustrated” is, at a minimum, delayed along the
transportation chain and will not move until all problems are
resolved. Many times, the shipment never reaches the intended
recipient. When using a GPC to purchase items with delivery to a
destination outside the United States, two methods of
transportation generally are available: commercial door-to-door and
the DTS. If commercial shipping is not used, a purchaser must
coordinate with his/her transportation service support office
(e.g., Installation Transportation Office, Transportation
Management Office, or Supply Support Activity) before ordering the
item. The Component ordering the item with a GPC is responsible for
ensuring the shipper (i.e., vendor) is provided the completed MSL
to place on the cargo before it arrives at a DoD facility for
movement in DTS. Shipments entering the DTS require additional
funding and shipping, marking, and packaging instructions. Prior to
shipment of hazardous material, the shipper is required to certify
shipment to the final destination by attaching a certification
certificate/document on the package in accordance with
International Air Transport Association or International Maritime
Dangerous Goods code, etc. Using only the stateside DTS military
transit port or intermediate point without including the final
destination DoDAAC in-country will cause a shipment to become
frustrated.</p>

Delivery</strong>. <span class="ph" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_6-2__Hlk152851478"></span>Cardholders generally
should seek vendors that have the required inventory supply (or
labor capacity, for services) to enable delivery of the purchase
within 30 calendar days while also meeting the requirements at a
fair and reasonable price. Delivery timeframes in excess of 30 days
may cause problems such as tracking purchases against monthly
billing cycle limits and shipping items charged to a closed
account.</p>
      <p class="p List1">g. <strong class="ph b">Purchase File Documentation</strong>. Collection and retention of GPC documentation in centralized, electronic records is mandated to support Federal-Government-wide paperless initiatives; ensure information is available to support program operations and oversight functions; and fulfill record retention requirements.

CHs must upload documentation throughout the billing cycle to assist BOs, A/OPCs, and auditors in completing transaction reviews per DoD SmartPay® 3 Transition Memorandum #6. CHs will attach documents for each billing cycle before approving their statement. BOs should review the transaction documentation prior to certifying the managing account. Records retention requirements are addressed in the <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#AFARS_Appendix-EE_6-2">6-2. GPC Purchasing Process</a>. The <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#AFARS_Appendix-EE_6-2">6-2. GPC Purchasing Process</a> requires that the CH include acceptance documentation for every purchase.

      <p class="p List2">1) Army Purchase Request &amp; Approval (PR&amp;A)
or equivalent​*</p>
      <p class="p List2">2) 889 Representation​*</p>

      <p class="p List2">6) Local agency requirements</p>
      <p class="p">* For individual slot training payments, CHs must upload the SF
182 or equivalent in lieu of items 1) and 2) above. CHs must redact
any personally identifiable information (PII) before uploading.</p>
      <p class="p List1">h. The Accountable Property Officer (APO)
determines if the goods purchased will be placed on APO records in
accordance with AR 710-4. Cardholders are required to provide
receipts of accountable goods to the APO within 5 business days of
obtaining the receipt.</p>
      <p class="p List1">i. <strong class="ph b">Independent Receipt and
Acceptance</strong>. CHs must obtain proof of independent receipt
and acceptance for all purchases. The CH will ensure receipt and
acceptance is properly performed and confirmed through
documentation by a government employee other than the purchasing
CH. The individual verifying receipt may be the CH’s
supervisor or other designated individual, as appropriate. CHs must
upload the documentation in the servicing bank’s EAS.
Shipping items to a home or alternative work address requires
approval documentation from the Level 3 A/OPC in the purchase file.
The BO verifies the existence of receipt and acceptance
documentation during reconciliation of the billing statement.
Acceptable documentation includes (but is not limited to) the
following:​</p>
      <p class="p List2">1) Signed invoice, packing slip or equivalent.
​In addition to the signature, the receiver should include
the date of receipt, printed name, telephone number, and office

      <p class="p List2">4) WAWF Purchase Card Receiving Report.</p>
      <p class="p List1">j. <strong class="ph b">File Retention</strong>. If the
complete file documentation is uploaded in the bank’s EAS,
CHs are not required to maintain a duplicate hardcopy or electronic
file. The servicing bank will retain all uploaded files for the
required timeframe. BOs are responsible for ensuring that CHs
upload documentation. BOs must retain existing hardcopy files for
six years in accordance with FAR Part 4 that are not uploaded into
the bank’s EAS.</p>
      <p class="p List1">k. <strong class="ph b">Cybersecurity</strong>. The Army GPC
community must be aware of cybersecurity risks when making
purchases using the GPC. Some of the key cyber supply-chain risks

        <p class="p List1">a. Effective August 13, 2020, FAR Case 2018-017
amends the FAR to implement section 889(a)(1(B) of the John S.
McCain NDAA for Fiscal Year 2019 which prohibits Federal agencies
from purchasing products or services from entities that use covered
equipment or services as a substantial or essential component of
any system, or as critical technology as part of any system,
regardless of whether that usage is in performance of work under
Federal contract. <a class="xref" href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/asda/dpc/cp/cyber/gpc.html" target="_blank">

            <u class="ph u">GPC
Memorandum dated June 29, 2022</u>
          </a> provides further guidance on
completing the required fields. CHs must record 889 Designation
information in the bank’s EAS.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">889 Representation</strong>. Federal
law requires CHs to obtain a current 889 representation for each
transaction and to include the representation with their
transaction documentation. The representation contains the language
from FAR 52.204-26, Covered Telecommunications Equipment or
Services- Representation. CHs may obtain the vendor’s 889
representation by using one of the following methods:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Search for vendor on the 889 GSA Easy Search
Tool: <a class="xref" href="https://889.smartpay.gsa.gov/" target="_blank">https://889.smartpay.gsa.gov/</a>.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Use the robotic process automation (RPA) tool
to search SAM.gov. Send an email to <a class="xref" href="mailto:info@section889request.com" target="_blank">
            <u class="ph u">info@section889request.com</u>
          </a>
with the vendor’s Unique Entity ID (UEI) or Cage code in the
subject line. Do not include any text in the body of the email. The
RPA will return an email with the vendor’s FAR 52.204-26
language, if applicable.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Log into the <a class="xref" href="https://www.sam.gov/" target="_blank">
            <u class="ph u">System for Award Management
(SAM.gov) website</u>.</a> Locate the vendor’s entity
registration and review FAR 52.204-26, under Reps and Certs.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Use the vendor’s completed 889
representation form. The form must be dated and signed. Completed
forms are valid for 1 year after date of signature unless the
vendor updates their systems at which time the vendor will need to
fill out a new 889 form.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. The requirement to obtain an 889 representation
does not apply under the following conditions:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Contract payments. When the GPC is used as a
method of payment against a contract, the Contracting Officer is
responsible for ensuring compliance prior to award.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Inter/intra-governmental payments.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) SF 182 individual training payments.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Fraudulent (external) transactions.</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) Fees (e.g., convenience check fees).</p>
        <p class="p List2">6) Refunds and transaction credits/discounts.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. Pursuant to DoD policy, bank EAS entries must
indicate how the vendor’s 889 representation was obtained.
For 100% of transactions, CH must enter appropriate 889 designation
in the bank’s EAS. CHs must enter one of the allowable codes
in Table 6-2 in the following locations in the bank’s EAS, as
applicable:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) CHs creating manual orders will use the
“889 Designation” field in Order Management.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) CHs receiving editable eOrders will use the
“889 Designation” field in Order Management.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) CHs receiving non-editable eOrders will use the
“889 Designation” field in the Custom Fields tab in
Transaction Management.</p>
        <p class="p">BOs must check for bank EAS entries when reconciling. BOs and
A/OPCs must monitor 889 compliance during DM case dispositions and
should use the “Cyber Security Non-Compliance” finding
for cases without an 889 bank EAS entry once CI 193 is
implemented.</p>

      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">Use of Third-Party Payment
Processors</strong>. In no instance are CHs authorized to establish
an account when using a third-party payment processor, as doing so
could require acceptance of or agreement to terms and conditions or
result in commitment of funds that have not been legally allocated
for purchases. Transactions using third-party payment processors
are considered high risk, as all available transaction data may not
be completely passed to the issuing bank (which can adversely
affect reporting, reconciliation, and oversight, including data
mining (detection of improper card use)), and may adversely affect
transaction dispute terms and processes, among other
considerations. When selecting merchants to fulfill requirements,
CHs will use the following procedures:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Minimize use of third-party payment processors
to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Ask if the merchant would require use of a
third-party payment processor, if there is any doubt regarding
merchant use of one.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) If it is still found necessary to purchase from
a merchant requiring a third-party payment processor, CHs and BOs
must ensure adequate supporting documentation clearly showing there
was a detailed review of the purchase, and that purchase from a
merchant requiring use of a third-party payment processor was
unavoidable.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. GPC oversight personnel and CHs should be aware
that in accordance with <a class="xref" href="https://smartpay.gsa.gov/policies-and-audits/smart-bulletins/023/" target="_blank">GSA
Smart Bulletin #023</a>, third-party payment policy does not apply
to e-commerce platforms or brick-and-mortar merchants that do not
accept payment using third-party payment processors.</p>

      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. GSA SmartPay GPC accounts are centrally billed
accounts (CBAs) and, as such, should be exempt from state taxes.

Cardholders can download a copy of the specific State letter to
present to a vendor when the vendor is requesting a tax-exempt

for GPC accounts under the heading “Purchase Account”

        <p class="p List1">c. For purchases within the U.S., CHs are
responsible for notifying vendors of the tax exemption and ensuring
no sales tax is included in their purchase, except where
applicable. Cardholders must inform the merchant that the purchase
is for official U.S. Government purposes and, therefore, is not
subject to state or local sales tax. A/OPCs may request embossing
of the statement “U.S. GOVT TAX EXEMPT” when ordering a
GPC.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Exceptions</strong>. Some states (e.g.,
Hawaii, Illinois) levy a General Excise Tax (GET) on businesses
selling tangible personal property which is allowed to be passed on
to the Federal Government. Arizona levies a Transaction Privilege
Tax (TPT). CHs are required to pay the GET and TPT when applied to
a GPC purchase.</p>

Surcharges</h2>
      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. Surcharges are fees that a retailer adds to the
cost of a purchase when a customer uses a credit card. As a result
of the settlement between a class of retailers and the brands on
January 27, 2013, merchants in the U.S. and U.S. Territories are
permitted to impose a surcharge on cardholders when a credit card
is used. Not all merchants impose a surcharge, and some states
(e.g., Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, New
York, Oklahoma, Texas, and Utah) prohibit merchant surcharges.
Cardholders who receive a surcharge in any of the above-mentioned
states should report the merchant to the proper State
authority.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. Cardholders are required to be notified in
advance if a merchant will impose a surcharge. Merchants must also
include the surcharge fee on all receipts. Surcharges are allowable
up to 4%. The limits vary by brand and by merchant discount rate.

future delays. If the account has been suspended for late
certification more than once, any request to reinstate the account
must come from the activity responsible for the account.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. The Certifying Officer’s minimum
qualifications and eligibility are discussed in DoD FMR Volume 5,
Chapter 33. Certifying Officers are responsible for the accuracy of
payments, including designation of the proper appropriation(s) or
other funds certified to the paying office and disbursing officer.
To certify GPC invoices for payment by DFAS, the BO must be
appointed as and accept the responsibilities of a Certifying
Officer using the DD Form 577 generated in JAM. The BO certifies
the statement as the Certifying Officer, and the RM certifies the
funding in GFEBS/other.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Cardholder Statement Reconciliation and
Certification</strong>. The Army certifies invoices for payment
after all purchased items have been confirmed. This procedure is
called “Confirm and Pay.” Any transactions that cannot
be reconciled and approved for payment, will not be approved in the
bank’s EAS by the BO. ANG and certain other Army accounts
supporting the Air Force certify invoices for payment following the
“Pay and Confirm” model. Cardholders must match and
approve transactions throughout the month to ensure accuracy and
identify and resolve any funding errors. If a charged amount is
incorrect, the CH must contact the vendor to resolve the
discrepancy and may dispute the transaction, if necessary.
Cardholders must also upload transaction documentation throughout
the month to ensure BO visibility of purchase information. If the
statement is correct at the end of the billing cycle, the CH must
approve the statement within three business days of the billing
cycle end date. For Army agencies that do not utilize the bank's
EAS for monthly certification, per the DoD FMR, Vol 10 Chapter 23,
Figure 23-2, the CH must complete a monthly certification statement
as part of their reconciliation process.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. Cardholders are responsible for reconciling the
charges appearing on each statement for their GPC with receipts,
purchase log, and other supporting documentation. Reconciling a
card account involves the following key actions:</p>
      <p class="p List2">1) Review the transactions on the statement from
the card-issuing bank and match them to the purchase log. Note:
Transaction review and invoice obligation will be completed in only
one system (i.e., either the bank EAS or another waiver-approved
automated system, but never both). Component policy and procedures
will designate the automated system in which CHs will perform
review and obligation.</p>
      <p class="p List2">2) Reconcile/reallocate/dispute transactions, as
appropriate. For each transaction posted to the statement,
reallocate, if appropriate, from the default to an alternate LOA
and approve or dispute each charge as appropriate.</p>
      <p class="p List2">3) Approve the statement.</p>
      <p class="p List2">4) Upload supporting documentation in the
bank’s EAS.</p>
      <p class="p List2">5) If the CH does not reconcile and approve the
statement within 15 days after the close of the billing cycle, the
CH is locked out of the file and the BO is required to perform the
CH reconciliation/approval role. After a BO certifies a statement
on the bank’s EAS, the transaction file is locked and no
further changes to the invoice are permitted.</p>
      <p class="p List1">f. <strong class="ph b">Billing Official
Certification</strong>. Reconciling and certifying a managing
account involves the following key actions:</p>
      <p class="p List2">1) Review transactions to ensure they are legal,
proper, correct, and mission essential.</p>
      <p class="p List2">2) Ensure all supporting documentation is obtained
and correct. Billing officials should review the uploaded
transaction documentation in AXOL to confirm all transactions are
reconciled and approved for payment, receipt is verified, and all
supporting documentation is loaded in the bank’s EAS prior to
certification.</p>
      <p class="p List2">3) Ensure CH reviews have been completed
properly.</p>
      <p class="p List2">4) Ensure receipt of all accountable property has
been properly documented.</p>
      <p class="p List2">5) Final-approve their CHs’ transactions and
certify the billing statement within five business days of the
billing cycle end date.</p>
      <p class="p List2">6) For improper purchases (including unauthorized
charges made by a properly appointed CH or GPC transactions
0intended for Government use but not permitted by law, regulation,
or Component policy, such as splitting purchases), the Government
is liable to pay; however, action may be taken against the CH.</p>
      <p class="p List2">7) If BOs find a questionable or fraudulent
transaction, they should contact their A/OPC and follow the
guidance in section 6-10.</p>
      <p class="p List1">g. <strong class="ph b">Processing Credits</strong>. The <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#AFARS_Appendix-EE_6-9">6-9. Payments of Monthly Invoices</a> is the authoritative source of guidance related to application of credits. As stated in the FMR, transaction credits are funds sent back to DoD from the contracted bank resulting from returned items, billing errors, overpayments, duplicate payments, or erroneous payments. The <a class="xref" href="https://smartpay.gsa.gov/about/master-contract/#gsa-smartpay-3-master-contract" target="_blank">GSA SP3 Master Contract</a> defines “credit” as “any transaction that reduces the amount due to the agency/organization or account holder.” Transaction credits must be credited to the original appropriation from which they were disbursed. Transaction credits will be posted as credits against CH statements, using the default LOA at the CH statement level, and should be reallocated as appropriate if the default LOA did not incur the original expenditure. In the case where a closed account carries a credit balance, the amount will be sent via check or using ACH to an installation account predetermined by the A/OPC. Checks will be addressed to “U.S. Treasury.” The A/OPC will work with his/her RM in identifying an account and determining how the credit will be distributed across LOAs as warranted. The BO will send the check and LOA(s) to the supporting accounting office with a request to deposit.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">6-10.</span> Disputes, Defective Items and
Fraudulent Transactions</h2>
      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">Disputes</strong>. Cardholders must
protect the Army’s interest by initiating disputes when
applicable. Failure to do so may result in administrative or
disciplinary action. Transaction errors, such as duplicate billing,
non-receipt or cancellation of supplies or services, returned
supplies, invoice amount discrepancies, transaction paid by other
means (e.g., split payments w/another organization), must be
handled initially between the CH and the merchant. If the merchant
is unwilling to accommodate a resolution, the CH will file a
dispute in the bank’s EAS. If a dispute is resolved in favor
of the CH, a credit will be placed on the CH’s statement. If
the dispute is resolved in favor of the merchant, a letter will be
sent to the CH explaining the decision and, since the charge was
already paid, no further action will be taken. The steps below
outline the process for disputing a charge:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Attempt to resolve any issue directly with the
merchant prior to initiating a dispute.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Document all available information and attempts
to correct the dispute. This information will become part of the
supporting documentation.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Initiate the dispute in the bank’s EAS
(only after failing to resolve the issue with the merchant) as
early as possible, but within 45 days from the posted date of the
transaction.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Respond to any bank requests for additional
information.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Defective Items</strong>. If items or
services purchased are faulty or defective, the CH will obtain a
replacement or repair of the item or re-performance of the service
as soon as possible. If the merchant refuses to credit, replace,
repair the faulty item, or re-perform the service to satisfaction,
the CH will dispute the transaction.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Fraud</strong>. If the CH discovers
fraudulent transactions (e.g., use of a lost or stolen card) on the
statement, the CH will immediately contact the bank’s
Customer Service Department. The CH should also notify his A/OPC
and BO of any fraudulent activity. If fraudulent activity is
confirmed (which means a third party has gained access to the
account), the bank will terminate the account and replace it with a
new account number. All account information will transfer to the
new account and the CH will continue to work with the servicing
bank to resolve the fraudulent transactions.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. Only the CH or BO can approve, dispute, or
reallocate purchase card transactions. The servicing bank is
responsible to ensure adequate controls are in place within their
EAS to preclude anyone other than the BO from accessing, making
changes, and certifying the monthly billing statement.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">6-11.</span> Non-Disputable Charges</h2>
      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">Card Misuse by Cardholder</strong>.
Charges that involve misuse or abuse by the CH are not disputable
with the servicing bank. If the transaction was processed in
accordance with established controls (e.g., within the purchase
limits, not from a merchant with a blocked Merchant Category Code,
then the bank has fulfilled its responsibilities under the
contract, and the Government is obligated to make payment for the
transaction. The Government will take appropriate action, as
prescribed in Chapter 11, Disciplinary actions, to seek restitution
because of the improper misuse or abuse.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Sales Tax</strong>. If a charge
involves sales tax erroneously invoiced by the merchant, the amount
of the tax cannot be disputed with the bank. The CH should try to
obtain a credit from the merchant. If a credit is not obtained, the
CH should inform and request assistance from the A/OPC. The CH
should seek restitution via the guidance provided by the <a class="xref" href="https://smartpay.gsa.gov/smarttax/tax-information-by-state/" target="_blank">
            <u class="ph u">GSA
SmartPay Tax Exemption website</u>.</a> The CH should document the
file accordingly.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Shipping Costs</strong>. If a charge
involves shipping costs erroneously invoiced by the merchant, the
amount of the erroneous shipping costs cannot be disputed. The CH
should try to obtain a credit for the transportation costs from the
merchant. If a credit is not obtained, the CH should inform and
request assistance from the servicing bank. The CH should document
the file accordingly.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Convenience Checks</strong>. There is
no convenience check dispute process within the bank. Any concerns
with a purchase made by check must be resolved directly with the
merchant. The checkwriter is responsible for securing restitution
and/or credit for disputed purchases. The checkwriter will notify
the A/OPC and request assistance to resolve disputes if necessary.
Each organization is responsible for checks written on the account,
unless it is determined fraudulent activity is involved.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Third-party Payments</strong>. If a
dispute with a merchant involves a third-party payer (e.g., Google
Pay, PayPal), the dispute is not with the third-party payer, but
with the merchant. The bank has no privity to the transaction, and
the CH must resolve the dispute with the merchant and/or the credit
card company.</p>

      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. BOs must review LOAs selected by the CH as part
of the review, reconciliation, and certification process. Payments
are generally rejected because of missing or incorrect LOAs. The
Army’s financial management system will also reject missing
or incorrect LOAs, requiring the finance office to make corrections
or complete a manual payment in the system. When this happens, the
A/OPC will notify the BO when a payment has been rejected in the
system. The BO must immediately contact their RM for assistance in
obligating funds in the system and processing the manual payment.
For GFEBS-funded accounts, follow the GFEBS manual payment
process.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Steps for processing manual payments

        <p class="p List2">3) The BO may obtain the document control number
for each transaction by running the Standard Document Number report
from the bank’s EAS (located under Custom Reports).</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) After the document control number is applied,
the BO must forward the request for commitment, obligation, and

      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. GPC transaction documentation must be retained
for six years in accordance with FAR 4.805. Billing officials are
responsible for ensuring that record retention requirements are
met. GPC transactions with foreign military sales (FMS) funding
must follow the retention guidance in DoD FMR Volume 15, Chapter 6,
and ensure the FMS documents are retained for 10 years from the
date of final case closure.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Uploading Supporting
Documentation</strong>. CHs must upload all transaction supporting
documentation in the bank’s EAS. The uploaded documentation
is the CH’s official purchase file. If the complete file is
uploaded in the EAS, CHs do not need to maintain a duplicate
hardcopy or electronic file. For purchases that do not have
uploaded documentation, the CH or BO must retain the corresponding
hardcopy or electronic files for six years.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Corrective Action</strong>. When
documentation is not retained in accordance with the GPC file
retention policy, A/OPCs must evaluate the CH/BO’s record

        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Storage, Handling, and Contract files
(FAR 4.805)</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Procedures for the handling, storing, and
disposing of contract files must be in accordance with the National

can be found at <a class="xref" href="http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/grs.html" target="_blank">http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/grs.html</a>.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Procedures must consider documents held in all
types of media, including microfilm and various electronic
media.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) The Army may change the original medium to
facilitate storage if the requirements of the FAR 4.8, law, and
other regulations are satisfied.</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) The process used to create and store records
must record and reproduce the original document, including
signatures and other written and graphic images completely,
accurately, and clearly.</p>
        <p class="p List2">6) Data transfer, storage, and retrieval
procedures must protect the original data from alteration. Unless
law or other regulations require signed originals to be kept, they
may be destroyed after the responsible agency official verifies
that record copies on alternate media and copies reproduced from
the record copy are accurate, complete, and clear representations
of the originals.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. Original disbursing office records, along with
CH supporting documents in electronic format, negate the need for
the CH to store duplicate hardcopy documents.</p>
        <p class="p List1">f. Electronic record storage requires adequate
controls to ensure the digital images accurately represent the
corresponding paper documentation and to detect changes to an
original digital image. In addition, electronic storage must be in
a centrally managed location that has an established backup
process.</p>
        <p class="p List1">g. See 6-2.g. for GPC transaction documentation
and disbursing office records. For additional examples of documents
classified as disbursing office records, see DoD FMR Volume 5,
Chapter 15, 150803.</p>
        <p class="p List1">h. Receipts are considered supporting documents
for the certified billing statement. Original receipts are
preferred; however, printed electronic forms or copies of an
itemized receipt are acceptable. The receipt must be legible and
indicate vendor’s name and address, date of the purchase, and
paid by credit card or zero amount due. Goods must be
itemized/detailed with the item description, quantity, price, and
extended price. The BO maintains these records electronically. The
CH and BO may rely on the servicing bank’s EAS for supporting
documentation. Original records are considered Government property
and may not be removed from Government control by the BO for any
reason.</p>
        <p class="p List1">i. <strong class="ph b">Appointment Letters</strong>.
Delegation of authority letters and GPC appointment letters,
executed by both the appointer and the appointee, will be retained
in PIEE/JAM for six years after the delegation has been terminated
through personnel action such as the appointee’s separation,
retirement, or transfer.</p>
        <p class="p List1">j. A/OPCs must retain any paper-based or email
requests relating to new account issuance and maintenance for six
years after the date of account issuance or update.</p>
        <p class="p List1">k. Data residing in the bank’s EAS is

Services</h2>
      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. The GPC may be used to purchase non-personal
services up to the applicable MPT, whether recurring or
non-recurring. If recurring, the requirement is the total estimated
cost per fiscal year. Recurring services estimated to exceed the
MPT per fiscal year will be acquired through the contracting
office. Recurring services are performed at regular intervals and
have a demand that can be accurately predicted on a yearly basis.
Non-recurring services involve one-time, unpredictable, or
occasional requirements, and may be purchased with the GPC up to
the MPT whenever a requirement occurs.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. When a CH receives a request to purchase

Labor Standards</strong>. Examples include services performed by
carpenters, electricians, mechanics, plumbers, iron workers,
craftsmen, operating engineers, and other laborers. Other examples
include court reporters, administrative assistants, engineering
technicians, and paralegals. To determine whether a service is
subject to SCLS, CHs and A/OPCs can search the Service Contract Act
wage determinations in SAM.gov to locate a list of applicable
occupations for a specified state and county.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Services Not Subject to Service
