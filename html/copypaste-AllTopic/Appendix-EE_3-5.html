      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix_EE_topic_25__p__Toc147113860">a. Specific guidance on use of required sources and order of precedence of sources is prescribed in FAR, Part 8, and DFARS, Part 208, e.g., National Industries for the Blind (NIB), National Industries for the Severely Disabled (NISH), Federal Prison Industries (a.k.a. UNICOR), and FSS/GSA schedule requirements. In addition to those mandatory sources listed in FAR Part 8, cardholders should strongly consider using small and small disadvantaged businesses whenever possible. The AbilityOne Program is a mandatory source of supply, with any procurement method and at any dollar value, in compliance with the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled statute, (41 U.S.C. §8501-8506). The AbilityOne Program's mandatory status remains in effect for all purchases--including those under the micro-purchase threshold. A full line of AbilityOne products can be found at your local installation AbilityOne Base Supply Center, DOD EMALL Army Corridor, and through AbilityOne.com where installation agreements do not exist for Base Supply Centers.</p>

      <p class="p Text Body" id="AFARS_Appendix_EE_topic_25__qAFhnG">b. In accordance with AFARS 5139.101-90(a), Computer Hardware, Enterprise Software and Solution (CHESS) is the Army’s mandatory source for commercial Information Technology (IT) hardware and software purchases. CHESS, accessible at <a class="xref" href="https://chess.army.mil" target="_blank">
            <u class="ph u">https://chess.army.mil</u>
         </a>, is a set of multiple award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts that offer IT products and services that comply with NETCOM, Army and DoD policy and standards. Cardholders must utilize CHESS contracts and DoD enterprise software agreements first regardless of dollar value. Any purchase made outside of the CHESS contracts requires a waiver. The waiver process is located at <a class="xref" href="https://chess.army.mil" target="_blank">
            <u class="ph u">https://chess.army.mil</u>
         </a>. Waivers are granted when products are unavailable on CHESS contracts or when hardware and software is available at a lower price from an alternate source. A CHESS waiver does not constitute approval to purchase any product or deviate from any other Army regulation or policy. Individual waivers are approved by CHESS and Army organization/activity blanket waivers are approved by the Army Chief Information Officer (CIO)/G-6. There is no fee associated with using CHESS and cardholders should maximize the use of discounts when ordering off CHESS contracts.</p>
      <p class="p" id="AFARS_Appendix_EE_topic_25__Frmmtj">If no small business capability exists, CHESS contract vehicles are the preferred source for acquisition of IT services. Waivers from CHESS are not required when procuring IT services. However, if IT Hardware and Software are required as part of a non-CHESS IT services contract, a waiver for the hardware and software is required.</p>
      <p class="p Text Body" id="AFARS_Appendix_EE_topic_25__p_OLE_LINK12">c. Green procurement is the purchase of environmentally preferable products and services (see FAR 23.202, 23.403, and 23.703). The Army Green Procurement Policy Memorandum, dated 22 Nov 06, established the Army Green Procurement Program (GPP) policy that “All Army personnel must comply with green procurement requirements to facilitate attainment of the DOD goal of 100% compliance with mandatory Federal purchasing preference programs” (see AR 70-1). The Army Green Procurement Guide provides an overview of the Federal procurement preference programs and guidance on implementing an effective GPP including A/OPC and cardholder responsibilities. A copy of the guide can be found at: <a class="xref" href="http://www.garrison.hawaii.army.mil/sustainability/Documents/SustAcquisition/ArmyGreenProcurementGuide.pdf" target="_blank">

         </a>.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix_EE_topic_25__UnsGiV">(1) Training on GPP requirements should be conducted when cards are issued and on a recurring basis to provide updates and remind buyers of responsibilities and procedures. The Level 3/4 A/OPC should ensure that initial card training includes a module on green procurement, particularly the mandatory GPP requirements. Green procurement training is available from sources found in the Army Green Procurement Guide.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix_EE_topic_25__FUDtBd">(2) The Level 4 A/OPC is responsible for ensuring GPP compliance and documenting noncompliance on the semi-annual surveillance report.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix_EE_topic_25__UjfgGB">(3) Cardholders must show preference to recycled content and biobased products whenever they are cost effective and meet technical requirements. Installations must consider environmental factors in all purchasing decisions and give preference to those products and services designated by or recommended in Federal green purchasing preference programs.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix_EE_topic_25__ZLteCk">(4) Per the National Defense Authorization Act of 1998, as of January 1, 2004, paper purchased using the GPC must be 50% post-consumer recycled paper. If 50% post-consumer recycled paper is not available for purchase, then as an alternative to meeting the standards for all printing and writing papers, the minimum content standard shall be no less than 50% recovered materials.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix_EE_topic_25__PPZSnt">(5) Acquisition of EPA-designated items that do not meet the EPA minimum recovered material standards must be justified in writing if over the micro-purchase threshold. A written determination must cite one or more of the following reasons and be maintained by the cardholder for exemption from recovered material standards:</p>
      <p class="p List3" id="AFARS_Appendix_EE_topic_25__ydprDe">(a) Items containing EPA-recommended recovered content standards are not available within a reasonable period of time.</p>
      <p class="p List3" id="AFARS_Appendix_EE_topic_25__OMSjFk">(b) Items are only available at an unreasonable price. Include sufficient information to support price decision.</p>
      <p class="p List3" id="AFARS_Appendix_EE_topic_25__GytYxT">(c) Items are not available from a sufficient number of sources to maintain a satisfactory level of competition. Include list of sources queried.</p>
      <p class="p List3" id="AFARS_Appendix_EE_topic_25__aPXgqR">(d) Items based upon technical verification fail to meet performance standards or specifications.</p>
