        <p class="p List1">a. A/OPCs have several reporting tools that enable
them to manage their purchase program effectively through the
bank’s EAS. Most electronic reports are updated within two to
three days after a transaction. However, some reports are only
updated at the end of the billing cycle. A/OPCs will have access
through the EAS to monitor account holder transactions at any time.
By searching by account holder name or account number, A/OPCs can
track account holder transactions (e.g., transactions, payments,
disputes), as well as view account holder monthly statements.
A/OPCs may also contact the bank’s customer service at any
time to request information on a specific account.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. Program metrics will be implemented in each
contracting office to provide the SCO, A/OPCs, and key Army
officials with an assessment of the risk environment and feedback
as to whether card programs are satisfying overall strategic goals.
All A/OPCs will utilize the reports identified in Table 17-1 and
17-2 to review performance metrics and identify any systemic
deficiencies requiring corrective action(s).</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. A/OPCs should maximize utilization of reports
available on the GPC Business IT systems web sites such as the IOD
and AXOL. The reports can assist with conducting periodic and
annual surveillance inspections along with overall GPC Program
management. Many reports are available through the servicing
bank’s EAS, IOD, and PIEE system to assist A/OPCs in the
management and oversight of the GPC program. In addition to
reviewing these reports, A/OPCs at all levels should perform and
maintain certain metrics to assess the performance of their
program. These metrics include, but are not limited to, the
following:</p>
