      <span class="ph autonumber">1-1.</span> Overview</h2>
  <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. The Army Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFARS) Appendix EE provides policy guidance and procedures for the management of the Army Government Purchase Card (GPC) program. It implements and supplements sections of the Department of Defense (DoD) Government Charge Card Guidebook for Establishing and Managing Purchase, Travel, and Fuel Card Programs (hereinafter referred to as the DoD Charge Card Guidebook). If information is not discussed in this document or if this document is in conflict with the DoD GPC Policy, the DoD GPC Policy should be followed. This document applies to all purchases utilizing Army-issued GPCs. </p>
      <p class="p List1">b. Refer recommended changes and questions about the AFARS Appendix EE to the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army (Procurement) (ODASA(P)). Submit requests for waivers through the chain of command. Compliance with the AFARS Appendix EE is mandatory.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. The GPC program provides Army and supported organizations a simplified, streamlined method of purchasing and paying for supplies, services, construction projects, and contract payments. The program complies with Federal, DoD, and Army statutory and regulatory guidance, as well as the terms and conditions specified in the most current General Services Administration (GSA) SmartPay® 3 Master Contract. The primary benefit of the GPC Program is that the card-issuing banks provide a commercial purchase and payment service that replaces the paper-based, time-consuming purchase order process; reduces procurement lead time; provides transaction cost savings; reduces procurement office workload; provides refunds; and facilitates payment to include reductions in interest payments.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. The AFARS Appendix EE provides the procedures to use within the Army, including Army National Guard (ARNG) and Air National Guard (ANG), to establish and manage the Army GPC program. Army activities may supplement (i.e., adopt more stringent internal control requirements than the requirements cited herein), but not change this policy. However, as these are risk-managed programs, activities should maintain a proper balance between the control environment and ease of use to ensure that the benefits of the card continue to accrue. These procedures establish Army-wide standards designed to provide all Army activities with a foundation upon which to build specific standard operating procedures governing their programs.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-1__Toc532909289">e. Nonappropriated Fund (NAF) activities implement policies and procedures governing the Army’s Morale, Welfare, and Recreation programs and regulations for Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities (NAFI). Chaplaincy activities implement policies and procedures governing Army Chaplain Corps activities. Army NAFIs/entities must operate within the parameters of these procedures to include Public Health Command (PHC) NAFIs, Department of Defense Education Activities (DoDEA) NAFIs, and Army National Guard NAFIs. NAF activities will comply with the Department of Defense Policies and Procedures Governing Non-Appropriated Funds SmartPay® 3 Government-wide Commercial Purchase Card Use – SP3 Transition Memorandum #11.</p>

    <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">The purchase card can be used in three ways, depending on the value
            of the transaction and the authority of the cardholder (CH). See
            Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.301. Table 1-1 summarizes
            the three methods and provides descriptions and examples. </p>

            purchase fixed-price commercial supplies and services that do not
            require the CH to agree to any terms and conditions other than price
            and delivery. These purchases are limited to the applicable
            micro-purchase threshold (MPT).</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Micro-purchases (Convenience Check).</strong> Convenience checks may
            be used and set up under a separate billing official (BO) account to
            buy commercially available, fixed-price supplies and services to
            fulfill mission-essential requirements. All check purchases must be
            within the applicable convenience check MPT. A separate account must
            be issued for each convenience check account.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Orders Against Pre-Existing Contract Vehicles.</strong> The GPC may
            be used to place task or delivery orders against pre-priced contract
            vehicles and agreements if authorized in the basic contract, basic
            ordering agreement, or blanket purchase agreement. (Appropriated
            fund CHs cannot purchase against nonappropriated fund
            contracts).</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Contract Payments.</strong> The GPC may be used to make contract
            payments against fully funded contracts found to be advantageous to
            the Government when compared to other methods of payment, and the
            contractor accepts payment by the GPC. The contract should include
            the third-party payment clause identified in FAR 32.1108, Payment by
            Governmentwide Commercial Purchase Card; however, GPC contract
            payments may be made if the contractor agrees to accept the GPC as a
            method of payment.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">1-3.</span> Information and Waiver Process</h2>
  <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. Cardholders should direct GPC-related questions to their billing
      official. If the BO cannot resolve the issue, they should direct the issue
      to their Agency/Organization Program Coordinator (A/OPC) (Level 4 A/OPC).
      If the A/OPC cannot resolve an issue, the A/OPC should direct the question
      to the Oversight Agency/Organization Program Coordinator (OA/OPC) (Level 3
      A/OPC). If the OA/OPC cannot resolve the issue, the OA/OPC should consult
      the Component Program Manager (CPM) (Level 2 A/OPC) for guidance.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. All waivers, exceptions, and deviations to the guidance provided in
      AFARS Appendix EE must be in writing and routed to the ODASA(P) CPM for
      approval. Requests to waive, take exception to, or deviate from the rules,
      regulations, processes or procedures will be reviewed on a case-by-case
      basis. Requests for waivers should be submitted through the GPC chain of
      command. The CPM will retain copies of all approved waiver packages. In
      times of emergencies, a waiver approval may be obtained either through
      email or telephone call from the CPM with a follow up waiver request
      letter from the requesting command/activity. The letter must detail the
      reasons for the request and what adverse mission impact would occur if the
      waiver was not granted.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">1-5.</span> GPC Authority</h2>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. GPC programs require procurement authority to operate and cannot be
established or maintained unless procurement authority is granted in accordance
with governing laws and regulations and delegated through a contracting activity
identified in Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS)
Procedures, Guidance, and Information (PGI) 202.101 and the DoD Charge Card
Guidebook. Contracting authority flows from authorities granted in Titles 10 and
41, United States Code (10 and 41 USC) from DoD to the Secretary of the Army to
the Heads of Contracting Activities (HCAs). The HCA re-delegates contracting
authority to local procurement offices. The Senior Contracting Official (SCO) or
Chief of Contracting Office (CCO) may re-delegate their GPC procurement
authority listed in Table 1-3 to OA/OPCs or A/OPCs for OA/OPCs and A/OPCs to
appoint cardholders and convenience check account holders through the Delegation
of Contracting Authority Letter produced in the Joint Appointment Module (JAM)
within the <a class="xref" href="https://piee.eb.mil/xhtml/unauth/home/login.xhtml" target="_blank">Procurement Integrated Enterprise Environment (PIEE)</a>.
See sections 1-8 and 5-1 for more information. Cardholders must countersign to
acknowledge this responsibility.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. The Joint Appointment Module (JAM), an application within PIEE, is the
mandatory enterprise tool for appointing and delegating authority to GPC
personnel.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. Orientation and training are prerequisites to receiving GPC delegated
authority via an appointment in JAM. Training requirements are listed in Chapter
4.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. Generally, only a Government employee can be a cardholder or billing
official. National Guard traditional members and State employees should not be
CHs or BOs. The following exceptions apply:</p>
      <p class="p">1) Foreign nationals may be appointed as CHs only if they are direct hires
working for the U.S. Government. However, commanders/directors should consider
the potential consequences of appointing foreign nationals as CHs in countries
where Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs) or local laws do not subject the
foreign national employee to the same pecuniary or general financial liability
or disciplinary actions for charge card violation as U.S. citizens.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC) instructors are members of
the Armed Forces in accordance with USACC Regulation 145-2, section 4-2, and may
be designated micro-purchase procurement authority as GPC cardholders. See FAR
1.603-3(b).</p>

  <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p">These procedures apply to all GPC purchases with cards and convenience checks issued by the Army.</p>
      <p class="p List1">a. Non-Army tenant organizations issued Army GPCs or convenience checks by an Army contracting office are also subject to these procedures. All BOs, CHs, A/OPCs, Resource Managers (RMs), Logisticians, and other stakeholders participating in the Army GPC program are subject to these procedures, including any non-Army tenant organizations where the Army has contracting authority and oversight responsibilities (such as ANG units).</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. The ODASA(P) has overall responsibility for the Army GPC program. Each Army command, organization, or activity utilizing Army GPCs has the responsibility for the following actions:</p>
      <p class="p">1) Provide adequate resources and effective internal controls to ensure the appropriate management, operation, training, and oversight is in place to operate a local GPC program effectively and efficiently in compliance with Army policies and procedures.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Establish and maintain a command climate to prevent Army personnel or others from exercising undue influence over the actions of an A/OPC, BO or CH.</p>
      <p class="p">3) Take appropriate informal and formal disciplinary actions in the event of noncompliance, fraud, misuse and/or abuse. Disciplinary actions should be based on the severity and frequency of the infraction and can range from informal actions such as written or verbal counseling, to demotion, removal, loss of security clearance, or potential criminal prosecution.</p>

            1402 Certificate of Appointment to purchase supplies and services as
            prescribed in DFARS 213.301(3). Contracting officers may use this
            authority to make purchases up to the applicable simplified
            acquisition threshold in support of declared contingency or
            emergency events.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Contract Ordering Official.</strong> This authority allows CHs with

            existing contracts (e.g., GSA FSS, BPAs, FedMall contracts, CHESS
            contracts) to fulfill mission-essential requirements for supplies
            and services valued up to the Contract Ordering Official single
            purchase limit and to use the GPC to pay for these orders/purchases.
            When using this authority, CHs must 1) ensure they are authorized to
            place orders by the contract terms and conditions, 2) ensure the
            order will comply with all the contracts terms and conditions, and
            3) follow all applicable ordering procedures. When ordering above
            the MPT, CH should obtain pricing from small business when
            small business can meet the requirements. The CH should obtain
            quotes from at least three sources. If restricting competition to
            fewer than three sources, the CH should document the circumstances
