      <p id="p_OLE_LINK4" outputclass="Normal">The evaluation of key internal controls should
            result in a specific determination of their effectiveness. Contracting managers shall
            use the checklist questions in appendix BB to test key controls of contracting functions
            through a combination of document analysis, direct observation, and random sampling. The
            annual statement of assurance and supporting documents shall include a corrective action
            plan for deficient answers to checklist questions. The contracting checklist in this
            appendix is not all-inclusive and each contracting activity should supplement the
            checklist with area-specific questions (e.g., major systems, etc.). Formal evaluations
            of key management controls must be conducted at least once every five years (Army
            Regulation 11-2).</p>
