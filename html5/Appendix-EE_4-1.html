This section provides specific management controls required of GPC programs, guidelines for disciplining abusers, and other control information. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-123, Appendix B, provides additional guidance on implementing strong internal controls. PCOLS is designed to both maintain the integrity of these controls and validate their effectiveness in safeguarding Government resources. Management officials are responsible for establishing a process of internal controls that is (1) designed to provide reasonable assurance that the GPC program is used efficiently, effectively, and legally to achieve the purpose for which the program was established and (2) is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>

      <p class="p file:/home/ec2-user/ditatool/tce/AFARS/AFARS_Fixed/dita/Appendix-EE_4-1.ditap:4;10:42 List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-1__qKEwdH">(2) <strong class="ph b file:/home/ec2-user/ditatool/tce/AFARS/AFARS_Fixed/dita/Appendix-EE_4-1.ditab:2;10:49">Maintain Positive System of Funds Control</strong>
         <strong class="ph b file:/home/ec2-user/ditatool/tce/AFARS/AFARS_Fixed/dita/Appendix-EE_4-1.ditab:3;11:13">:</strong> Spending limits (such as monthly and office limits) are tied directly to the funding allocated for each card account (monthly, quarterly, and semiannually). Fund limits should be consistent with historical spending patterns to minimize Government exposure and ensure adequate funds availability. This provides an overall control to ensure funding is available prior to purchases being made with the card.</p>

Key duties such as making purchases (CH), verifying purchases are proper (A/BO), authorizing payments (BO and FSO), certifying funding (Finance and Resource Managers), independent acceptance for accountable property, and reviewing and auditing functions (A/OPC and Property Book Officers) must be assigned to different individuals to the greatest extent possible to minimize the risk of loss to the Government.</p>

The A/BO is required to approve or reject each purchase made by the CHs under his/her hierarchy. When the A/BO has completed their review of each invoice submitted for his/her card accounts, the A/BO, acting in the role of Certifying Officer, can certify the entire invoice as legal, proper, and correct in accordance with his/her responsibilities.</p>
