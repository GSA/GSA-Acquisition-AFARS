            information on source selection processes and techniques that the Army uses for
            competitive, negotiated acquisitions using either formal or informal source selection
            procedures. See DoD Source Selection Procedures at 1.3, page 2 for exceptions.</p>
      <p class="p Normal">(2) The AS3 is a comprehensive source selection resource which
            recites best practices that promote source selection flexibility and consistency within
            a given framework in Army source selections. Army personnel shall use the AS3 resource
            when conducting competitive source selections. The extent to which personnel will use
            the processes and techniques described in this supplement will depend upon the
            complexity and dollar value of each acquisition and the available resources. When using
            the AS3, apply prudent business sense to tailor the processes to fit the
            circumstances.</p>

An understanding of the development of each of these positions is important when preparing for negotiations. The Defense Acquisition University’s Acquisition Community Connection, available via the Internet at https://acc.dau.mil/pricing, contains the DoD Contract Pricing Reference Guides, which discuss in depth the pricing techniques and factors contracting officers should consider when developing negotiation positions.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p Normal">(a)  Contracting officers must document within the price negotiation memorandum the results of the negotiation in sufficient detail to clearly establish all significant aspects of the contract action.  When utilizing a consolidated POM/PNM, the contracting officer must ensure the POM/PNM contains all required content for both documents, in accordance with FAR 15.406 and DFARS PGI 205.406, and is stated in sufficient detail to reconstruct actions and decisions and to support the reasonableness of the final price. </p>
      <p class="p Normal">(b)  If the final negotiated price is within a range specifically approved as the prenegotiation objective, and if negotiations did not present information that calls into question the reasonableness of the previously-approved price range, the written approval obtained under 5115.406-1(1) may also serve as the approval for the consolidated POM/PNM.  The approved POM/PNM may be used in determining the negotiated price to be fair and reasonable.  Notwithstanding this subsection, the contracting officer still must obtain all other required pre-award approvals.   </p>
