      <p outputclass="List1" class="- topic/p ">(a)  It is preferable to have multiple BPAs for similar items and to establish prices using reverse auctions among BPA holders.  If quantities are too small and not conducive to using a reverse auction, then when practicable, contracting officers should establish pre-priced BPAs by negotiating firm unit prices for specific periods of time or by incorporating suppliersâ€™ price lists or catalogs in BPAs.</p>
      <p outputclass="List1" class="- topic/p ">(b)  Contracting officers should not establish blanket purchase agreements for supplies or services when the use of unpriced purchase orders is appropriate (see FAR 13.302-2).</p>
