      <span class="ph autonumber">8-1.</span> SF 182 Training Payments (Non-FAR based training actions)</h2>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">References</strong>. 5 USC 4109 gives the head of an agency the authority to
pay for training and makes Training, Education and Professional Development
(TE&amp;PD) services a valid expense of the U.S. Government. DoD FMR Volume 10,
Chapter 12 provides authority for Miscellaneous Payments of TE&amp;PD both as a
direct reimbursement to employee and payment to non-Government sources. DoDI
1400.25, Volume 410 provides policy and conditions to make a Miscellaneous
Payment for TE&amp;PD services directly to a non-Government source. This same
instruction requires specific conditions to be met in order to use the GPC. FAR
13 provides authority for Simplified Acquisition and micro-purchase of services.
DoD policy is to use the GPC to make FMR-based Miscellaneous Payments for
TE&amp;PD services from non-Government sources. Because the preference is to pay
the vendor or educational institution directly as opposed to reimbursing the
employee, the FMR refers to this DoD Instruction. 5 USC 4109 authorizes the head
of an agency, under the regulations prescribed in 5 USC 4118(a)(8), to reimburse
employees for necessary training expenses (e.g., tuition and matriculation fees;
library and laboratory services; purchase or rental of books, materials, and
supplies; and other services or facilities directly related to employee
training). See DoDI 1400.25 Volume 410 for additional information regarding the
appropriate use.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">SF 182</strong>. The SF 182 (Authorization, Agreement, and Certification of
Training) is the authorized and required training obligating document. GPC
payments for commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) training must be accompanied by an
SF 182 or approved equivalent. Authorized training may be provided by Government
or non-Government sources. Each student attending training must complete an SF
182. A single SF 182 must not be used for a group of individuals to attend
training. CHs must include the signed SF 182 or equivalent and a copy of the
training certificate or proof of completion in their file documentation. See
Army Publications for the current version of the SF 182.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. The GPC will be the method of payment for all commercial training
requirements using the SF 182, valued at or below $25,000, in lieu of an
employee reimbursement by miscellaneous payments in accordance with the DoD FMR
Volume 10, Chapter 12, Section 3.23, and DoDI 1400.25, Volume 410. The SF 182 is
not a FAR-based transaction. As such, the MPT for services does not apply to
these types of transactions. DoD has made a determination and uses the GPC to
purchase training authorized by use of a single SF 182 to a cap of $25,000 per
transaction.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. The GPC will be used by CHs (primarily TE&amp;PD Educational Office
personnel) to pay for COTS training and education up to a single purchase limit
of $25,000. See AFARS 5113.270-90(g).</p>
      <p class="p"> 
         <strong class="ph b">Individual Slots in Existing Training Course</strong>. Each slot purchased may
be considered its own transaction, even when paid together. Each student must
have an approved SF 182. Each slot must be below $25,000 per student. CHs may
purchase each slot as a separate transaction or may combine the slots into a
single transaction for the total amount. To be considered COTS, training from
non-Government sources must meet the following criteria:</p>
      <p class="p">1) <strong class="ph b">Regularly scheduled.</strong> The TE&amp;PD event can be found in an
established offering, whether in print or online. The event does not have to be
held on a scheduled date and time if the training provider makes it available at
any time, such as an online course.</p>
      <p class="p">2) <strong class="ph b">Off-the-shelf TE&amp;PD service available to the general public.</strong>
The service is a commercially available TE&amp;PD event or a planned series of
the same event, activity, service, or material, requiring no modification prior
to use. Such training may occur on or off federal property and may include
non-federal employees.</p>
      <p class="p">3) <strong class="ph b">Priced the same for everyone in the same category.</strong> The service is
priced the same per student, course, service, or training space. In other words,
the same event is offered at an equal price to all customers.</p>

  <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title3">
      <span class="ph autonumber">8-2.</span> Tailored Training</h2>
  <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. Tailored training is any training that falls outside of "regularly scheduled," "off-the-shelf," or "priced the same for everyone.” The following are indicators of tailored training:</p>
      <p class="p">1) Creating a new training course.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Adding terms and conditions to a regularly scheduled, COTS training event.</p>
      <p class="p">3) Taking an existing course and tailoring it to be agency-specific (e.g., mission, regulations, policies, personnel, etc.).</p>
      <p class="p">4) Materials and content are tailored specific to the agency.</p>
      <p class="p">5) Typically requires a detailed Statement of Work (SOW) and review/acceptance of deliverable.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. If the Government has a need for tailored training or tailored training materials, the requirement must be placed on a Government contract by a warranted Contracting Officer. See DoD Charge Card Guidebook A.1.3. The GPC may be used as the payment method but not the procurement method. A CH must <strong class="ph b">never</strong> sign any vendor written terms and conditions that would financially bind the Government without proper authority.</p>

   <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title4">
      <span class="ph autonumber">8-3.</span> FAR-based Training Actions</h2>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p">FAR-based training actions are subject to the applicable services MPT. They
are not considered SF 182 payments, and the $25,000 limit does not apply. The
following paragraphs identify the types of training requests that are considered
FAR-based actions:</p>
      <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">Buying an Existing (Not Tailored) Imported Course.</strong> In this case,
the purchase is for the entire COTS course, and the MPT applies to the dollar
value of the all-inclusive total cost of the course (instructor time, materials,
etc.). Depending on the subject matter of the training, these courses may be
considered “professional services.” No SF 182 is needed for individuals.</p>
      <p class="p">1) <strong class="ph b">Example #1</strong>. You are buying a 1-day Myers-Briggs seminar for 35
employees at a total cost of $9,500. The GPC can be used as a PROCUREMENT and
PAYMENT mechanism because it falls within the $10,000 MPT.</p>
      <p class="p">2) <strong class="ph b">Example #2</strong>. You are buying a 3-day mid-career retirement course for
150 participants held at the agency’s headquarters. The cost of the course is
$30,000. Do not take the $30,000 and divide by 150 participants to arrive at a
price per student ($200) and think you can simply pay for 150 separate slots and
split those payments against your SPL. The MPT must be applied to the aggregate
cost in this case, or $30,000. In this case, the cost exceeds the MPT and the
cardholder’s SPL and must be purchased via other formal means (i.e., Contracting
Office / Contracting Officer). The GPC cannot be used for procuring the course
but may be used as a PAYMENT mechanism within the SPL of the CH and agency
policy.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Subscriptions for Group Training Services</strong>. Subscriptions for access
to on-demand training are considered a supply. Cardholders can use the GPC to
pay for subscriptions up to the supply MPT.</p>
      <p class="p">In this case, the purchase is a subscription for access to on-demand
training, and the MPT applies to the dollar value of the total cost of the
subscription. Subscription services for groups or organizations typically set a
threshold or limit to the number of employees who can access training services
via the subscription for the flat subscription cost; the costs are not pro-rated
or adjusted by the number of actual employees that actually access the
training.</p>
      <p class="p">1) <strong class="ph b">Example.</strong> You are buying a subscription to a training vendor’s
on-demand training site for a cost of $9,000. Up to 300 employees can access
on-demand training under the subscription and the cost is not pro-rated based on
actual use. The purchase could be made with the purchase card because it falls
within the $10,000 MPT.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Tailored Training</strong>. The GPC cannot be used to purchase tailored
training.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">8-4.</span> Purchase Training Examples</h2>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. In accordance with current acquisition and financial management policy,
the SF 182 authority is authorized for use only under the following
conditions:</p>
      <p class="p">1) SF 182s are granted to individual employees; and</p>
      <p class="p">2) The individual employees will attend a regularly scheduled, off-the-shelf
course that is available to the public and priced the same for everyone in the
same category (e.g., price per student) and requires no tailoring; and</p>
      <p class="p">3) The GPC is being used to pay the training provider directly instead of
reimbursing the employee.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. If a course is being purchased (e.g., group training), the SF 182
authority does not apply and should not be used. The purchase is a FAR-based
acquisition that generally needs to be sent to the supporting contracting office
for action. Exceptions that allow action by a CH include the following:</p>
      <p class="p">1) The course is priced below the applicable MPT and does not require the CH
to agree to terms and conditions other than price and delivery. The purchase can
be made following micro-purchase procedures; or</p>
      <p class="p">2) The course is available under indefinite delivery contracts not requiring
the GPC Ordering Official CH to agree to terms and conditions other than price
and delivery.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. The following examples demonstrate how to apply the above guidance in
purchasing situations:</p>
      <p class="p">1) <strong class="ph b">Situation 1</strong>. Five individuals each have an approved SF 182
authorizing them to attend leadership training. The cost of the training is
$5,800 per student (seat). <em class="ph i">The training will take place off the
installation</em>. The training is for attendance at a regularly scheduled,
off-the-shelf course that is available to the public and priced the same for
everyone in the same category (e.g., price per student) and requires no
tailoring.</p>
      <p class="p"> 
         <strong class="ph b">Resolution</strong>: The training institution should invoice $5,800 for each
approved student. In accordance with DoD FMR Volume 10, Chapter 12, Section
120323, “to minimize the need for reimbursing the employee, the preference is to
pay the training provider directly.” Even though the total price the Government
would otherwise be obligated to pay to reimburse all attendees directly is
$29,000, the CH may use their GPC for each of these payments because none
individually exceeds the $25,000 SF 182 payment threshold. When the Government
has recurring requirements for the same course the contracting office should be
consulted to determine if a contract-based solution should be used to ensure the
Government receives the best pricing. GPC SF 182 training payment authority may
only be used to pay vendors directly for training approved on an SF 182 that
would otherwise be directly reimbursed to an individual; the price of any one SF
182-based GPC transaction may not exceed $25,000.</p>
      <p class="p">2) <strong class="ph b">Situation 2.</strong> The requiring activity has a requirement to provide a
retirement training course; up to 30 individuals can attend. <em class="ph i">The training
will take place off the installation. </em> The estimated cost for the retirement
training is $11,000 for the course.</p>
      <p class="p"> 
         <strong class="ph b">Resolution</strong>: The activity is purchasing a course (group training),
which is considered a service and a FAR-based action. Taking the training off
the installation is not a relevant factor for considering if the GPC can be used
in this situation. This service is professional, and subject to the applicable
services MPT of $10,000. Since the total price is above the MPT, the request
must be submitted to the contracting office for action.</p>
      <p class="p">3) <strong class="ph b">Situation 3</strong>. The requiring activity is requesting a (regularly
scheduled, COTS, priced the same for everyone, no tailoring) existing leadership
training course for 15 students for a total cost of $6,000. <em class="ph i">The training will
take place at the installation</em>.</p>
      <p class="p"> 
         <strong class="ph b">Resolution</strong>: The activity is purchasing a course (group training),
which is considered a service and a FAR-based action. The SF 182 is not
applicable for this situation and cannot be used for this purchase requirement.
This service is professional; therefore, the purchase is subject to the
applicable services MPT of $10,000. A CH authorized to make micro-purchases on
the open market can make the purchase as long as it does not require agreement
to terms and conditions other than price and delivery. Open market
micro-purchases are limited to the MPT ($10,000 or when in direct support of an
Emergency-type Operation, one of the higher MPTs could apply). Alternatively, if
a fixed-price indefinite delivery contract does not require the CH to agree to
any terms and conditions, a CH with Ordering Official authority could make the
purchase.</p>
      <p class="p">4) <strong class="ph b">Situation 4.</strong> The requiring activity is requesting specialized
forklift training at a Government facility. A forklift operator from a local
sales and repair shop will be conducting the class. The quote includes a SOW and
an outline of agency-specific topics to cover. The estimated cost of the
training is $5,000.</p>
      <p class="p"> 
         <strong class="ph b">Resolution</strong>: The GPC cannot be used. The vendor is offering tailored
training, which is considered a service and a FAR-based action. The applicable
services MPT is $2,500, because the instructor is an OSHA-certified forklift
operator. This occupation falls under the services subject to 41 USC Chapter 67,
Service Contract Labor Standards. The request should be directed to the
contracting office.</p>
      <p class="p">5) <strong class="ph b">Situation 5</strong>. Three individuals each have an approved SF 182
authorizing them to attend leadership training. The cost of the training is
$2,000 per student (seat). <em class="ph i">The training is to be held virtually</em>. The
training is for attendance at a regularly scheduled, off-the-shelf course that
is available to the public and priced the same for everyone in the same category
(e.g., price per student) and requires no tailoring.</p>
      <p class="p"> 
         <strong class="ph b">Resolution</strong>: The training institution should invoice $2,000 for each
approved student. In accordance with DoD FMR Volume 10, Chapter 12, Section
120323, “to minimize the need for reimbursing the employee, the preference is to
pay the training provider directly.” The CH may use their training GPC for each
of these payments because none individually exceeds the $25,000 SF 182 payment
threshold. When the Government has recurring requirements for the same course
the contracting office should be consulted to determine if a contract-based
solution should be used to ensure the Government receives the best pricing.</p>

    <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">Commanders at all levels must ensure that the Government's interests are protected when an employee fails to complete training for which the Army pays all or part of the training expenses. This policy includes both Government and non-Government training.</p>
        <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">Government Training</strong>. If an employee fails to complete training satisfactorily, one of the following actions will take place:</p>
        <p class="p">1) If failure is due to the employee's negligence or willful misconduct, appropriate disciplinary action will be taken.</p>
        <p class="p">2) If failure is for reasons beyond the employee's control (such as illness or recall by proper authority), no action will be taken.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Non-Government Training</strong>.</p>
        <p class="p">1) If an activity pays for training only when the training is completed or requires the employee to share the training costs, the activity will fully inform the employee in advance. In some cases, this information may be included in the continued service agreement. (Training must still be approved in advance.)</p>
        <p class="p">2) If an employee fails to complete non-Government training satisfactorily, actions in a. or b. below will be taken. Employees must be advised in writing of these requirements before the training starts. If the failure to complete training is due to the employee's negligence or willful misconduct, the employee must repay training expenses other than salary costs. If appropriate, disciplinary action will be taken. If failure is for reasons beyond the employee's control, no action will be taken.</p>
