        <p class="p List1">b. If FPI/UNICOR and AbilityOne participating
nonprofit agencies produce identical supplies or services,
FPI/UNICOR is the higher priority for supplies and AbilityOne is
the higher priority for services (FAR 8.603 and 8.002). Unlike
FPI/UNICOR procedures, AbilityOne purchasing procedures are
applicable to all purchases regardless of dollar value and do not
allow contracting officers to authorize purchase from an alternate
source. If the requirement can be fulfilled with an AbilityOne
product on the <a class="xref" href="https://www.abilityone.gov/procurement_list/index.html" target="_blank">Procurement
List</a>, the CH must purchase from FPI/UNICOR unless they receive
a waiver from FPI/UNICOR allowing them to purchase from
AbilityOne.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. Cardholders may request a waiver from
AbilityOne following the procedures at <a class="xref" href="https://www.abilityone.gov/laws,_regulations_and_policy/documents/US%20AbilityOne%20Commission%20Policy%2051%20541%20Requirement%20to%20Purchase%20PL%20Products%20Instead%20of%20Essentially%20the%20Same%20Final.pdf" target="_blank">
            <u class="ph u">AbilityOne’s

          </a>. Before AbilityOne approves any waiver
request, it can (1) review product information to ensure the
alternate product is essentially the same as the AbilityOne
product, and (2) offer a price match.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. AbilityOne purchasing procedures do not allow
contracting officers to authorize purchase from an alternate
source. Prices of items on the <a class="xref" href="https://www.abilityone.gov/procurement_list/index.html" target="_blank">Procurement

      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. In accordance with FAR 8.004, CHs should
consider use of non-mandatory sources such as FSS contracts/BPAs
(e.g., GSA Advantage); Governmentwide acquisition contracts;
multi-Component contracts (e.g., DoD FedMall contracts), and
commercial sources in the open market (including educational and
nonprofit institutions).</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. When purchasing against a BPA, CHs will ensure
the requirements of FAR 13.303-5 are met. When purchasing against
an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contract, CHs will
follow the ordering procedures as specified by the contracting
officer and FAR Part 16. When purchasing against a FSS contract,
CHs will follow the ordering procedures at FAR 8.405. CHs will
attempt to distribute FSS orders among contractors that can meet
the Army’s need in accordance with FAR 8.405-1(b).</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Small Businesses</strong>. In
accordance with FAR 19.203, the requirement to set aside
acquisitions for small businesses does not apply to purchases
valued at or below the MPT. However, in accordance with FAR 19.201,
CHs should consider small businesses and socioeconomic programs to
the maximum extent practicable when using the GPC for purchases at
or below the MPT.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">General Services Administration (GSA)
Programs.</strong> GSA maintains the Federal Supply Schedule
program, also known as the GSA Schedules Program or the Multiple
Award Schedule Program. GSA offers an online shopping service
called GSA Advantage! through which CHs may place orders against
Schedules. CHs may also use GSA Advantage! to place orders through
GSA’s Global Supply System, a GSA wholesale supply source,
formerly known as "GSA Stock" or the "Customer Supply Center." GSA
Advantage! enables CHs to search specific information (e.g.,
national stock number, part number, common name), review delivery
options, place orders directly with Schedule contractors, and pay
for orders using the GPC. CHs may place orders up to the MPT with
any FSS contractor that can meet the agency’s needs. Although
not required to solicit from a specific number of schedule
contractors, ordering activities should attempt to distribute
orders among contractors. Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative
(FSSI) agreements are accessible at FSSI. Cardholders must consider
GSA’s commercial platforms before using commercial
sources.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">FedMall.</strong> FedMall is a
Government e-commerce acquisition platform which may be used for
procuring supplies beyond those listed in Section 8-1. CHs who use
FedMall are required to register for a FedMall account. To
register, CHs will need to know their DoDAAC or their Activity
Address Code (AAC). If FedMall does not recognize the CH’s
DoDAAC or AAC, CHs should contact their A/OPC to request the
contracting office’s Procurement DoDAAC for registration.
FedMall is accessible through the CH’s PIEE account via the
FedMall icon.</p>
        <p class="p List1">f. <strong class="ph b">Commercial Sources.</strong> Before
buying from a commercial source, CHs must review applicable
mandatory sources and non-mandatory Government sources. See Tables
9-1 and 9-2. Cardholders should rotate commercial sources.
Cardholders may purchase from a commercial source if the requested
supplies or services are unavailable from the applicable mandatory
source provided they obtain the appropriate waivers.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">9-10.</span> Commercial Platforms</h2>
      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. An e-marketplace platform is an online platform
where CHs can evaluate and order products via a portal operated by
a vendor: the portal provider. The e-marketplace platforms can
offer portal provider products and/or third-party vendor products.
Portal providers and third-party vendors are generally responsible
for fulfilling orders for their respective products. The
e-marketplace model encourages robust competition not only at the
platform level by offering millions of products across thousands of
suppliers, but also at the product level, with multiple suppliers
competing to sell a given product.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <a class="xref" href="https://www.gsa.gov/buy-through-us/purchasing-programs/commercial-platforms" target="_blank">GSA’s
Commercial Platforms program</a> (also known as GSA’s
e-commerce platforms) provides a managed channel for open-market
purchases through select commercial online platforms.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. Third-party payment processor policy does not
apply to e-commerce platforms or brick-and-mortar merchants that do
not accept payment using third-party payment processors. In the
e-commerce space, this includes, at a minimum, those in GSA’s
Commercial Platforms program, and AmazonBusiness.com. If a platform
changes their payment practices and begins allowing use of
third-party payment processors, the Army will validate each
applicable e-commerce platform continues to disallow use of
third-party payment processors. This revalidation will occur at
least semi-annually, to include notifying GPC oversight personnel
and CHs whether the applicable e-commerce platform does
not/continues not to accept payment using third party payment
processors.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">E-Marketplace Platform Method of
Payment</strong>. The GPC is the only authorized method of payment
for purchases placed on the e-marketplace platforms. Cardholders
are not allowed to use any other forms of payment, including
third-party payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Venmo, Google Wallet,
WePay) or payments using any form of cryptocurrency.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Compliance with AbilityOne</strong>.
Mandatory sources such as AbilityOne are effectively represented
and promoted in this program. Rather than simply state that
e-marketplaces are required to “block and sub” the
commercial item for the AbilityOne item, GSA requires platform
providers to prevent the sale of a commercial item which is
“essentially the same” as an item on the AbilityOne
Procurement List. In addition, GSA requires platform providers to
ensure the vendors selling AbilityOne products are, in fact,
authorized distributors.</p>
        <p class="p List1">f. <strong class="ph b">Data Visibility</strong>. Identifying
leakage through the commercial platforms will allow the Army the
ability to identify purchases that could be going to AbilityOne
distributors, small business suppliers, excluded entities, or spend
outside of strategic or mandatory-use agency contracts. This data
then allows the Army to take the necessary action to appropriately
manage this spend. Spend data is available to the Army through
on-demand reports and dashboards, allowing the Army to see
line-level spend from all e-marketplace platforms. Cardholders also
have real-time, account level access to their purchasing data
through the e-marketplace platforms for purchase card
reconciliation and spend analysis.</p>
