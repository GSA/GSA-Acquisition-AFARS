      <span class="ph autonumber">6-1.</span> Procurement Transactions</h2>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. Purchases below the MPT are exempt from the Competition in Contracting
Act, Buy American Act, Economy Act, Service Contract Labor Standards Act, Wage
Rates Requirements Act, and the Small Business Set-Aside Program. Nothing in
this chapter exempts a cardholder from using the proper contracting channels
when making purchases exceeding the MPT.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. Requiring activities must perform acquisition planning to identify
procurement needs; consider strategic sourcing vehicles (e.g., BPAs, CHESS,
GSA); and initiate procurement actions with sufficient lead time to buy
appropriate products at the right price from the right suppliers in a timely
manner. Requirements and logistics personnel should avoid issuing requirements
on an urgent basis or with unrealistic delivery or performance schedules, since
it generally restricts competition and increases prices. Ordering from existing
contracts (e.g., BPAs, CHESS, or GSA FSS) can only be done by an appointed
ordering official, including purchases below the MPT.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. Purchase requirements exceeding the MPTs or delegations of authority
established in Tables 1-2 and 1-3 must be referred to a contracting office.
Splitting requirements into smaller parts to avoid formal contracting
procedures, competition requirements, or to keep spending limitations under the
MPT is prohibited. The GPC may be used for non-personal recurring services
performed at regular intervals; however, recurring service requirements
estimated to exceed the MPT per FY are not authorized.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. Cardholders must use the mandatory sources identified in Chapter 9 before
deciding to use commercial sources. GPC micro-purchases should be distributed
equitably among qualified suppliers, with special consideration paid to
supporting the installation AbilityOne Base Supply Center, and local, small, and
small disadvantaged businesses.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. Cardholders are responsible for procuring green products and services
under the Green Procurement Program as prescribed by Executive Order 13834 and
by DoD and Army policies. Green procurement applies to the purchase of recovered
materials, energy and water efficient products, alternative fuels and fuel
efficiency, bio-based products, non-ozone depleting substances, environmentally
preferable products and services, and toxic and hazardous chemicals. The
following are mandatory Green Procurement purchases: paper, toner, office
products, office recycle containers, and office trash cans. The following are
the only exceptions to purchasing green products and services: the pricing is
considered unreasonable; item/service does not meet reasonable standards; or
item/service will not meet the time frame needed. Exceptions must be documented.
Recommended sources for green products are AbilityOne, FedMall, and GSA
Advantage.</p>
      <p class="p List1">f. <strong class="ph b">OCONUS Units</strong>. For the use of the GPC outside the U.S., CHs must
follow policy in accordance with DFARS 213.301(2). To ensure the CH does not
exceed $25,000 for OCONUS purchases, the total purchase price must include the
currency conversion rate prior to making the purchase. If a CH makes a purchase
from an OCONUS location for use OCONUS and the vendor is located in the U.S.,
this would be considered a reach-back purchase and the MPT for a reach-back
purchase is $10,000. Any reach-back purchase over $10,000 is subject to
simplified acquisition procedures and should be sent to the contracting office
to make the purchase.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_6-1__OLE_LINK21">g. For purchases made in the Contiguous United States (CONUS)
for use overseas, the CH must contact their local Director of Logistics Traffic
Management Office for assistance regarding transportation and packaging
requirements and/or instructions prior to contacting the vendor. CHs must ensure
the final price includes all costs associated with the mode of transportation
and packaging selected to the destination country, customs import duties, and
any other charges that may accrue. See DoD Directive 4500.54-E, DoD Foreign
Clearance Program for compliance with host nation customs requirements.</p>
      <p class="p List1">h. <strong class="ph b">OCONUS Value-Added Tax (VAT) Forms</strong>. The cost of the VAT can be
charged on the GPC. Cardholders must contact their AOPC for local guidance and
procedures involving the usage of the VAT form. The following VAT forms are
provided on the GPC PAM website for information purposes only:</p>
      <p class="p">1) <a class="xref" href="https://www.companyformationbelgium.com/vat-registration-belgium" target="_blank">Belgium VAT</a> 
      </p>
      <p class="p">2) <a class="xref" href="http://abwicklungsschein.de/en/" target="_blank">Germany VAT</a> 
      </p>
      <p class="p">3) Republic of Korea VAT</p>
      <p class="p">4) For all other countries, contact the local Morale, Welfare and Recreation
(MWR) office.</p>
      <p class="p List1">i. <strong class="ph b">Terms and Conditions</strong>. Cardholders do not have the authority to
approve or sign written vendor terms and conditions. Cardholders will consult
their A/OPC or local legal office for additional guidance.</p>
      <p class="p List1">j. <strong class="ph b">Convenience Check Accounts</strong>. The management controls, procedures,
and restrictions included in this regulation also apply to the use of
convenience checking accounts. Convenience checks are an alternative only when
the GPC is not feasible and the activity has evaluated all alternatives and
determined the checks as the most advantageous. Before a check is issued, the
requiring organization must document their effort to find a merchant that
accepts the GPC. Convenience checks must not be used for more than one half of
the MPT per Public Law 115-91. See Chapter 10.</p>
      <p class="p List1">k. <strong class="ph b">GPC Surveillance Requirements</strong>. Oversight of the GPC program will
follow procedures outlined in <a class="xref" href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/asda/dpc/ce/pc/smart-pay.html#sp36" target="_blank">Department of Defense SmartPay3 Government-wide Commercial

        <p class="p List1">g. <strong class="ph b">Independent Receipt and Acceptance</strong>. CHs will obtain
            independent receipt and acceptance for all purchases. The CH will
            ensure receipt and acceptance is properly performed and confirmed
            through proper documentation by an individual other than the CH. The
            person verifying receipt must sign, date, and write "received" on
            the merchant’s receipt, packing slip, invoice, or equivalent
            document. Email confirmation is also acceptable. The individual
            verifying receipt may be the CH’s supervisor or other designated
            individual, as appropriate. CHs must upload the signed document or
            email confirmation in the servicing bank’s EAS. Shipping items to a
            home or alternative work address requires approval documentation
            from the Level 3 A/OPC in the purchase file. The BO verifies the
            existence of receipt and acceptance documentation during
            reconciliation of the billing statement.</p>
        <p class="p List1">h. <strong class="ph b">File Retention</strong>. If the complete file documentation is
            uploaded in the bank’s EAS, CHs are not required to maintain a
            duplicate hardcopy or electronic file. The servicing bank will
            retain all uploaded files for the required timeframe. BOs are
            responsible for ensuring that CHs upload documentation. BOs must
            retain existing hardcopy files for six years in accordance with FAR
            Part 4 that are not uploaded into the bank’s EAS.</p>

    <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. Effective August 13, 2020, FAR Case 2018-017 amends the FAR to
            implement section 889(a)(1(B) of the John S. McCain NDAA for Fiscal
            Year 2019 which prohibits Federal agencies from purchasing products
            or services from entities that use covered equipment or services as
            a substantial or essential component of any system, or as critical
            technology as part of any system, regardless of whether that usage
            is in performance of work under Federal contract. <a class="xref" href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/asda/dpc/cp/cyber/gpc.html" target="_blank">DPC 889 Memorandum dated September 9, 2020</a>
            requires recording of specific 889 designations in the bank’s EAS
            for <strong class="ph b">all</strong> GPC transactions. <a class="xref" href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/asda/dpc/ce/pc/docs/guides-docs/DPC-CeB_Memo-Recording_889_Designation_and_ETO_Values(GPC-2022-02).pdf" target="_blank">DPC GPC Memorandum dated June 29, 2022</a>
            provides further guidance on completing the required fields. CHs
            must record 889 Designation and Emergency Type Operation (ETO)
            information in the bank’s EAS.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. 889 Representation. Federal law requires CHs to obtain a current
            889 representation for each transaction and to include the
            representation with their transaction documentation. The
            representation contains the language from FAR 52.204-26, Covered
            Telecommunications Equipment or Services-Representation. CHs may
            obtain the vendor’s 889 representation by using one of the following
            methods:</p>
        <p class="p">1) Log into the <a class="xref" href="https://www.sam.gov/" target="_blank">System for Award Management (SAM.gov)
            website</a>. Locate the vendor’s entity registration and review
            FAR 52.204-26, under Reps and Certs.</p>
        <p class="p">2) Use the robotic process automation (RPA) tool to search SAM.gov.
            Send an email to <a class="xref" href="mailto:info@section889request.com" target="_blank">info@section889request.com</a> with the vendor’s
            Unique Entity ID (UEI) or Cage code in the subject line. Do not
            include any text in the body of the email. The RPA will return an
            email with the vendor’s FAR 52.204-26 language, if applicable.</p>
        <p class="p">3) Use the vendor’s completed 889 representation form. The form must
            be dated and signed. Completed forms are valid for 1 year after date
            of signature unless the vendor updates their systems at which time
            the vendor will need to fill out a new 889 form.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. The requirement to obtain an 889 representation does not apply
            under these conditions:</p>
        <p class="p">1) Contract payments. When the GPC is used as a method of payment
            against a contract, the Contracting Officer is responsible for
            ensuring compliance prior to award.</p>
        <p class="p">2) Inter/intra-governmental payments.</p>
        <p class="p">3) SF 182 training payments.</p>
        <p class="p">4) Fraudulent (external) transactions.</p>
        <p class="p">5) Fees (e.g., convenience check fees).</p>
        <p class="p">6) Refunds and transaction credits/discounts.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. Pursuant to DoD policy, bank EAS entries must indicate how the
            vendor’s 889 representation was obtained. CHs must enter one of the
            allowable codes in Table 6-2 in the following locations in the
            bank’s EAS, as applicable:</p>
        <p class="p">1) CHs creating manual orders will use the “889 Designation” field in
            Order Management.</p>
        <p class="p">2) CHs receiving editable eOrders will use the “889 Designation”
            field in Order Management.</p>
        <p class="p">3) CHs receiving non-editable eOrders will use the “889 Designation”
            field in the Custom Fields tab in Transaction Management.</p>
        <p class="p">4) For 100% of transactions, CH must enter appropriate 889
            designation in the bank’s EAS.</p>
        <p class="p">BOs must check for bank EAS entries when reconciling. BOs and A/OPCs
            must monitor 889 compliance during DM case dispositions and should
            use the “Cyber Security Non-Compliance” finding for cases without an
            889 bank EAS entry once CI 193 is implemented.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. <u class="ph u">Use of Third- Party Payment Processors</u>: In no instance are
Cardholders (CHs) authorized to establish an account when using a third-party
payment processor, as doing so could require acceptance of or agreement to terms
and conditions or result in commitment of funds that have not been legally
allocated for purchases. Transactions using third-party payment processors are
considered high risk, as all available transaction data may not be completely
passed to the issuing bank (which can adversely affect reporting,
reconciliation, and oversight, including data mining (detection of improper card
use)), and may adversely affect transaction dispute terms and processes, among
other considerations.</p>
      <p class="p">When selecting merchants to fulfill requirements, CHs shall use the following
procedures:</p>
      <p class="p">1) Minimize use of third-party payment processors to the maximum extent
practicable.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Ask if the merchant would require use of a third-party payment processor,
if there is any doubt regarding merchant use of one.</p>
      <p class="p">3) If it is still found necessary to purchase from a merchant that requires
uses a third-party payment processor, CHs and A/BOs must ensure adequate
supporting documentation clearly showing there was a detailed review of the
purchase, and that purchase from a merchant requiring use of a third-party
payment processor was unavoidable.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. Additionally, Component Program Managers must ensure CHs are:</p>
      <p class="p">1) Appropriately trained on DoD GPC Third-Party Payment Policy; DoD GPC
Policy for Non-DoD e-Commerce Platforms; related Component policy; and
third-party payment processor requirements and risks in OMB Circular A-123,
Appendix B; and GSA Smart Bulletin No. 023 entitled “GSA SmartPay-Third Party
Payment Processors”.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Never authorized to establish an account when using third-party payment
services for processing GPC payments.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. GPC oversight personnel and CHs should be aware that in accordance with
GSA Smart Bulletin No. 23, third-party payment policy does not apply to
e-commerce platforms or brick-and-mortar merchants that do not accept payment
using third-party payment processors. See Attachment 2 for additional
guidance.</p>

    <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. Centrally billed GPC accounts are exempt from state tax in every state but require tax exemption forms in certain states. See the <a class="xref" href="https://smartpay.gsa.gov/smarttax" target="_blank">GSA SmartPay website</a> for more information.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. For purchases within the U.S., CHs are responsible for notifying vendors of the tax exemption and ensuring no sales tax is included in their purchase, except where applicable. Cardholders must inform the merchant that the purchase is for official U.S. Government purposes and, therefore, is not subject to state or local sales tax.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. A/OPCs may request embossing of the statement “U.S. GOVT TAX EXEMPT” when ordering a GPC.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Exceptions</strong>. Some states (e.g., Hawaii, Illinois) levy a General Excise Tax (GET) on businesses selling tangible personal property which is allowed to be passed on to the Federal Government.

  <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. Surcharges are fees that a retailer adds to the cost of a purchase
      when a customer uses a credit card. As a result of the settlement between
      a class of retailers and the brands on January 27, 2013, merchants in the
      U.S. and U.S. Territories are permitted to impose a surcharge on
      cardholders when a credit card is used. Not all merchants impose a
      surcharge, and some states (e.g., Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Maine,
      Massachusetts, New York, Oklahoma, Texas, and Utah) prohibit merchant
      surcharges. Cardholders who receive a surcharge in any of the
      above-mentioned states should report the merchant to the proper State
      authority.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. Cardholders are required to be notified in advance if a merchant will
      impose a surcharge. Merchants must also include the surcharge fee on all
      receipts. Surcharges are allowable up to 4%. The limits vary by brand and
      by merchant discount rate. See <a class="xref" href="https://smartpay.gsa.gov/sites/default/files/downloads/FINAL-%20SP_SmartBulletin_No._017-Surcharges_Revised_102119.pdf" target="_blank">GSA SmartPay Bulletin #17</a>. If a merchant is
      imposing a surcharge, the CH may consider choosing another merchant that
      offers the same or similar item(s) to avoid paying the surcharge.</p>

      <p class="p">1) CH will ensure that the Accountable Property Officer (APO) reviews each purchase request form or the applicable financial system prior to making the purchase.</p>
      <p class="p">2) CH will provide purchase receipt to APO within 5 days of obtaining the receipt.</p>
      <p class="p">3) When performing monitoring and oversight reviews, APOs must assess whether CHs provided the GPC receipts to the APO.</p>
      <p class="p">4) When applicable, contract payment CHs must review and comply with WAWF Invoicing, Receipt, Acceptance and Property Transfer module in accordance with DFARS 232.7002, 232.7003, and 252.232-7003. See DoD Charge Card Guidebook Section A.4.4.1.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">Payment Delinquency Monitoring</strong>. A/OPCs must track managing account
certification after the end of the billing cycle and confirm whether the
payments processed. A/OPCs can use the Managing Account Approval Status and
Certification and Payment Report reports to identify accounts that have not been
certified. The servicing bank may send reports of delinquencies and potential
past due accounts. A/OPCs can also use the Past Due report in the bank’s EAS to
identify delinquent accounts. Past due notices (delinquencies over 30 days) must
be handled immediately. GPC stakeholders must work together to research and
correct any delinquency immediately. Delinquencies that are 60 days past due are
suspended as outlined in paragraph 5-6.b. The Army goal is to pay all accounts
on time. The Army maintains a zero tolerance for any percentage of receivables
over 180 days past due.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. The A/OPC will monitor account certifications and may suspend any account
that is not certified within 5 business days. If the A/OPC suspends an account,
once the account is certified, the A/OPC may reinstate the account. If the bank
suspends an account, once the account is certified and paid, the account is
automatically reinstated. The request to reinstate a suspended account due to
non-certification, must include an explanation of the delay in certification and
a plan to avoid future delays. If the account has been suspended for late
certification more than once, any request to reinstate the account must come
from the activity responsible for the account.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Cardholder Statement Reconciliation and Certification</strong>. Cardholders
must match and approve transactions throughout the month to ensure accuracy and
identify and resolve any funding errors. If a charged amount is incorrect, the
CH must contact the vendor to resolve the discrepancy and may dispute the
transaction, if necessary. Cardholders must also upload transaction
documentation throughout the month to ensure BO visibility of purchase
information. If the statement is correct at the end of the billing cycle, the CH
must approve the statement within three business days of the billing cycle end
date. For Army agencies that do not utilize the bank's EAS for monthly
certification, per the DoD FMR, Vol 10 Chapter 23, Figure 23-2, the CH must
complete a monthly certification statement as part of their reconciliation
process.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Billing Official Certification</strong>. BOs must review their CHs’
transactions and ensure that all purchases are legal, proper, and correct.
Billing officials must final-approve their CHs’ transactions and certify the
billing statement within five business days of the billing cycle end date. If
the BO finds a questionable transaction, they should not certify the statement.
They should contact their A/OPC for further guidance. Billing officials must
certify in order for DFAS to process the payment and the bank to receive and
post the payment. Time certification is essential in order to avoid delinquency
and interest from late payments. For Army agencies that do not utilize the
bank’s EAS for monthly certification, per DoD FMR, Vol 10 Chapter 23, Figures
23-1 and 23-2, the BO must complete a monthly review checklist and certification
statement.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Confirm and Pay</strong>. The Army certifies invoices for payment after all
purchased items have been confirmed. This procedure is called “Confirm and Pay.”
Before certifying the billing statement, BOs should review the uploaded
transaction documentation to confirm that the items arrived or services were
performed. Each BO should ensure all transactions are reconciled and approved
for payment, receipt is verified, and all supporting documentation is loaded in
the bank’s EAS prior to certification. Any transactions that cannot be
reconciled and approved for payment, will not be approved in the bank’s EAS by
the BO. ANG and certain other Army accounts supporting the Air Force certify
invoices for payment following the Pay and Confirm model. For ANG payment
related guidance, see DAFI 64-117.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">6-10.</span> Disputes, Defective Items and Fraudulent Transactions</h2>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. Cardholders must protect the Army’s interest by initiating disputes when
applicable. Failure to do so can result in administrative or disciplinary
action. The steps below outline the process for disputing a charge:</p>
      <p class="p">1) Attempt to resolve any issue directly with the merchant prior to
initiating a dispute.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Document all available information and attempts to correct the dispute.
This information will become part of the supporting documentation.</p>
      <p class="p">3) Initiate the dispute in the bank’s EAS (only after failing to resolve the
issue with the merchant) as early as possible, but within 90 days from the
posted date of the transaction.</p>
      <p class="p">4) Respond to any bank requests for additional information.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. If items or services purchased are faulty or defective, the CH will obtain
a replacement or repair of the item or re-performance of the service as soon as
possible. If the merchant refuses to credit, replace, repair the faulty item, or
re-perform the service to satisfaction, the CH will dispute the transaction.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. Transaction errors, such as duplicate billing, non-receipt or cancellation
of supplies or services, returned supplies, invoice amount discrepancies,
transaction paid by other means (e.g., split payments w/another organization),
must be handled initially between the cardholder and the merchant. If the
merchant is unwilling to accommodate a resolution, the cardholder will file a
dispute in the bank’s EAS. If a dispute is resolved in favor of the cardholder,
a credit will be placed on the cardholder’s statement. If the dispute is
resolved in favor of the merchant, a letter will be sent to the cardholder
explaining the decision and, since the charge was already paid, no further
action will be taken.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. If the CH discovers fraudulent transactions (e.g., use of a lost or stolen
card) on the statement, the CH will immediately contact the bank’s Customer
Service Department. The CH should also notify his A/OPC and BO of any fraudulent
activity. If fraudulent activity is confirmed (which means a third party has
gained access to the account), the bank will terminate the account and replace
it with a new account number. All account information will transfer to the new
account and the CH will continue to work with the servicing bank to resolve the
fraudulent transactions.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. The servicing bank must ensure that adequate controls are in place to
ensure the security of transaction data within their EAS. Only the CH or BO can
approve, dispute, or reallocate purchase card transactions. The servicing bank
must ensure that adequate controls are in place within their data warehouse to
preclude anyone other than the BO from accessing, making changes and certifying
the monthly billing statement.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">Card Misuse by Cardholder</strong>. Charges that involve misuse or abuse by
the CH are not disputable with the bank. If the transaction was processed in
accordance with established controls (e.g., within the purchase limits, not from
a merchant with a blocked Merchant Category Code, then the bank has fulfilled
its responsibilities under the contract, and the Government is obligated to make
payment for the transaction. The Government will seek recourse, as prescribed in
Chapter 13, Disciplinary actions, and seek restitution from the employee as a
result of their improper misuse or abuse.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Sales Tax</strong>. If a charge involves sales tax erroneously invoiced by
the merchant, the amount of the tax cannot be disputed. The CH should make an
effort to obtain a credit from the merchant. If a credit is not obtained, the CH
should inform and request assistance from the A/OPC. The CH should seek
restitution via the guidance provided by the <a class="xref" href="https://smartpay.gsa.gov/smarttax" target="_blank">GSA SmartPay Tax Exemption website</a>. The CH should
document the file accordingly.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Shipping Costs</strong>. If a charge involves shipping costs erroneously
invoiced by the merchant, the amount of the erroneous shipping costs cannot be
disputed. The CH should try to obtain a credit for the amount of the
transportation costs from the merchant. If a credit is not obtained, the CH
should inform and request assistance from the servicing bank. The CH should
document the file accordingly.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Convenience Checks</strong>. There is no convenience check dispute process
within the bank. Any concerns with a purchase made by check must be resolved
directly with the merchant. The checkwriter is responsible for securing
restitution and/or credit for disputed purchases. The checkwriter will notify
the A/OPC and request assistance to resolve disputes if necessary. Each
organization is responsible for checks written on the account, unless it is
determined fraudulent activity is involved.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Third-party Payments</strong>. If a dispute with a merchant involves a
third-party payer (e.g., Google Pay, PayPal), the dispute is not with the
third-party payer, but with the merchant. The bank has no privity to the
transaction, and the CH must resolve the dispute with the merchant and/or the
credit card company.</p>

  <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. BOs must review LOAs selected by the CH as part of the review, reconciliation, and certification process. Payments are generally rejected as a result of missing or incorrect LOAs. The Army’s financial management system will also reject missing or incorrect LOAs, requiring the finance office to make corrections or complete a manual payment in the system. When this happens, the A/OPC will notify the BO when a payment has been rejected in the system. The BO must immediately contact their RM for assistance in obligating funds in the system and processing the manual payment. For GFEBS-funded accounts, follow the GFEBS manual payment process.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Steps for processing manual payments for non-GFEBS-funded accounts</strong>.</p>
      <p class="p">1) Print the managing account statement from the servicing bank’s EAS (located under Account Information).</p>
      <p class="p">2) Download the Statement Signature Page and certify the statement with a pen and ink signature.</p>
      <p class="p">3) The BO may obtain the document control number for each transaction by running the Standard Document Number report from the bank’s EAS (located under Custom Reports).</p>
      <p class="p">4) After the document control number is applied, the BO must forward the request for commitment, obligation, and expense to the appropriate resource manager along with a copy of the certified GPC bank statement.</p>
      <p class="p">5) The resource manager must input the requirement to the financial management system within two business days of receipt.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">6-13.</span> File Retention</h2>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. GPC transaction documentation must be retained for six years in accordance
with FAR 4.805 and DoD Charge Card Guidebook Section A.1.14. Billing officials
are responsible for ensuring that record retention requirements are met. GPC
transactions with foreign military sales (FMS) funding must follow the retention
guidance in DoD FMR Volume 15, Chapter 6, and ensure the FMS documents are
retained for 10 years from the date of final case closure.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Uploading Supporting Documentation</strong>. CHs must upload all transaction
supporting documentation in the bank’s EAS. The uploaded documentation is the
CH’s official purchase file. If the complete file is uploaded in the EAS, CHs do
not need to maintain a duplicate hardcopy or electronic file. For purchases that
do not have uploaded documentation, the CH or BO must retain the corresponding
hardcopy or electronic files for six years.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Corrective Action</strong>. When documentation is not retained in accordance
with the GPC file retention policy, A/OPCs must evaluate the CH/BO’s record
retention processes and develop corrective action plans with target completion
dates to prevent recurrence. A/OPCs should take disciplinary action as necessary
for negligent CHs (e.g., suspending card accounts).</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. FAR 4.805 provides the following guidance on file storage: “Agencies must
prescribe procedures for the handling, storing, and disposing of contract
files…These procedures must take into account documents held in all types of
media. Agencies may change the original medium to facilitate storage as long as
the requirements of the part, law, and other regulations are satisfied. The
process used to create and store records must record and reproduce the original
document, including signatures and other written and graphic images completely,
accurately, and clearly. Data transfer, storage, and retrieval procedures must
protect the original data from alteration. Unless law or other regulations
require signed originals to be kept, they may be destroyed after the responsible
agency official verifies that record copies on alternate media and copies
reproduced from the record copy are accurate, complete, and clear
representations of the originals.”</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. Original disbursing office records (BO or Certifying Officer), along with
CH supporting documents in electronic format, negate the need for the CH to
store duplicate hardcopy documents.</p>
      <p class="p List1">f. Electronic record storage requires adequate controls to ensure the digital
images accurately represent the corresponding paper documentation and to detect
changes to an original digital image. In addition, electronic storage must be in
a centrally managed location that has an established backup process.</p>
      <p class="p List1">g. See 6-2.e for GPC transaction documentation and disbursing office records.
For additional examples of documents classified as disbursing office records,
see DoD FMR Volume 5, Chapter 15, 150803.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_6-13__OLE_LINK9">h. Receipts are considered supporting documents for the certified
billing statement. Original receipts are preferred; however, printed electronic
forms or copies of an itemized receipt are acceptable. The receipt must be
legible and indicate vendor’s name and address, date of the purchase, and paid
by credit card or zero amount due. Goods must be itemized/detailed with the item
description, quantity, price, and extended price. The BO maintains these records
in physical possession, or when appropriate, transfers them to a records holding
area. However, if certifying electronically, the CH and BO may rely on the
servicing bank’s EAS for supporting documentation. Original records are
considered Government property and may not be removed from Government control by
the BO for any reason.</p>
      <p class="p List1">i. <strong class="ph b">Appointment Letters</strong>. Delegation of authority letters and GPC
appointment letters, executed by both the appointer and the appointee, will be
retained in PIEE/JAM for six years after the delegation has been terminated
through personnel action such as the appointee’s separation, retirement, or
transfer.</p>
      <p class="p List1">j. A/OPCs must retain any paper-based or email requests relating to new
account issuance and maintenance for six years after the date of account
issuance or update.</p>
      <p class="p List1">k. Data residing in the bank’s EAS is maintained by the bank for six years.
Reports may be retrieved from the bank’s EAS for the previous two years. Reports
covering data for periods beyond the previous two years are available from the
bank upon request.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. The GPC may be used to purchase non-personal services up to the applicable
MPT, whether recurring or non-recurring. If recurring, the requirement is the
total estimated cost per fiscal year. Recurring services estimated to exceed the
MPT per fiscal year will be acquired through the contracting office. Recurring
services are performed at regular intervals and have a demand that can be
accurately predicted on a yearly basis. Non-recurring services involve one-time,
unpredictable, or occasional requirements, and may be purchased with the GPC up
to the MPT whenever a requirement occurs.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. When a CH receives a request to purchase services, it is crucial to
identify whether or not the services are subject to the Service Contract Labor
Standards (SCLS) and determine the applicable MPT.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Services Subject to Service Contract Labor Standards</strong>. Examples
include services performed by carpenters, electricians, mechanics, plumbers,
iron workers, craftsmen, operating engineers, and other laborers. Other examples
include court reporters, administrative assistants, engineering technicians, and
paralegals. To determine whether a service is subject to SCLS, CHs and A/OPCs
can search the Service Contract Act wage determinations in SAM.gov to locate a
list of applicable occupations for a specified state and county.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Services Not Subject to Service Contract Labor Standards</strong>. The
following services are not subject to SCLS:</p>
      <p class="p">1) <strong class="ph b">Professional Services</strong>. Examples include services performed by
architects, engineers, professors, chemists, lawyers, doctors of medicine or
dentistry, and software engineers. These services may include office work
related to operations, teaching, practice of law or medicine, and skilled
services such as computer services, sales, and business management. The primary
duty must be the performance of work by persons requiring knowledge of an
advanced type in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a
prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction or the performance of
work requiring invention, imagination, originality or talent in a recognized
field of artistic or creative endeavor. If unsure, CHs and A/OPCs can search the
Service Contract Act wage determinations in SAM.gov to confirm whether the type
of worker is on the list for the applicable location.</p>
      <p class="p">2) <strong class="ph b">Statutory Exempt from SCLS Coverage</strong>. These services include the

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. Cardholders must follow operational orders and coordinate with their Level
4 A/OPC regarding procedures for deployed or contingency situations. In most
cases, Army units deployed to a different AOR will receive new cards under the
AOR per the SOFA agreements.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. Units must coordinate with their Level 4 A/OPC. The transfer of program

prohibited. Deployed cards will be managed by the home station A/OPC.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. If after coordination with the contracting authority for the deployed
area, it is determined the deploying units are not taking their GPCs, these
accounts must be temporarily suspended by the A/OPC, upon notification from the
BO, during the period of deployment. If GPCs are authorized while deployed, the
local RM must make appropriate adjustments to the LOAs, and additional
information must be entered in the servicing bank’s EAS. The BO must notify the
A/OPC in writing if GPCs are authorized while deployed. OCONUS GPCs will be
managed to meet the program requirements of the issuing agency.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Active Component Units</strong>. Units deploying in support of contingency
operations should take their locally issued GPCs with them to use while
deployed. Prior to deployment, A/OPCs must coordinate with the contracting
authority in the contingency area to see if there are special requirements for
using the GPC while deployed in the AOR and ensure the cards' lines of
accounting are properly funded. GPCs are issued through contracting; therefore,
the decision on whether the GPC will be taken to deployed locations will be

not determine whether GPCs are taken to deployed locations.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Deploying National Guard (NG) Members</strong>. Deploying NG members may
continue to use their home station GPC up until they arrive at the Mobilization
(MOB) station. The NG home station Level 4 A/OPC deactivates the mobilized
soldier’s GPC account at this point, through temporary closure or termination.
The gaining activity in the new AOR will then determine if the NG member
requires a GPC. If it is determined that the mobilized NG member requires a GPC,
the Level 4 A/OPC in the new AOR will be responsible for issuance and oversight
responsibility of this new GPC account. All GPC accounts (CH and BO) for
mobilized NG members are managed by the Level 4 A/OPC to whom the NG member is
assigned. Cards are to be used in theater for mission essential requirements
only.</p>
