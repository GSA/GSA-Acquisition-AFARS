Managers at all levels should refer to Appendix BB, Management Control Evaluation Checklist, to evaluate their organizationâ€™s compliance with key management controls and to identify and correct weaknesses.  The list of questions in Appendix BB is not all-inclusive nor are managers required to respond to all of them.  Managers should tailor the list to include areas specific to each contracting office, and should include the Areas of Special Interest, which the DASA(P) issues each fiscal year.</p></conbody></concept>
