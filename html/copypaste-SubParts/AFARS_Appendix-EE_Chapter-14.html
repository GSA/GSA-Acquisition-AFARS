  <div class="body">
      <p class="p List1">a. Cardholders are presented with requests to buy a wide variety of items
      and services, and it can be difficult for CHs to determine whether the
      requested purchase is authorized. This chapter describes the
      characteristics of an authorized purchase; identifies items and services
      that are prohibited and restricted from purchase; and the exceptions under
      which they are allowable.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. Cardholders must contact their A/OPC or other local authority (e.g.,
      legal advisor, HCA, or resource manager) before making purchases that seem
      questionable or have the appearance of being inappropriate. When buying
      questionable items or services, CHs must include approval documentation in
      the purchase file.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. All exceptions must be on a per transaction basis after consultation
      with the A/OPC, legal counsel, HCA, SCO, CCO, or resource manager.
      Multiple requests for the same exception must be approved by the Level 3
      or 4 A/OPC responsible for issuing the GPC accounts. There may be
      exceptions to the guidance in this section. For example, the armed escort
      of prisoners may be a legitimate use of the GPC even though “escort
      services” qualify as a prohibited transaction. CHs must include the
      results of their consultations and determination to use the GPC in this
      manner with their transaction supporting data.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">14-1.</span> Authorized Purchases</h2>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">Determining whether a Purchase is Authorized</strong>. An authorized
purchase satisfies a current mission-related need at a fair and reasonable price
that meets all legal and regulatory requirements. It meets the following five
criteria:</p>
      <p class="p">1) <strong class="ph b">Lawful</strong>. Purchase is funded and authorized by law or regulation, and
the requested item/service fits the appropriation which is being used. See 48
CFR 13.301(a) and 31 USC 1301(a).</p>
      <p class="p">2) <strong class="ph b">Legitimate Government Need</strong>. Request is for official purposes and
not for the personal benefit of a Government employee.</p>
      <p class="p">3) <strong class="ph b">Bona Fide Need (Current Year Appropriation)</strong>. Request is for the
need of the current year of the appropriation. This rule does not prevent
maintaining a legitimate inventory at reasonable and historical levels. See 31
USC 1502.</p>
      <p class="p">4) <strong class="ph b">Minimum Needs of the Government</strong>. Request should not exceed what is
truly required. See FAR 11.103(c)(1).</p>
      <p class="p">5) <strong class="ph b">Fair and Reasonable Price</strong>. Price charged is fair to both parties,
considering the quality and timeliness of performance and delivery.
Micro-purchases may be awarded without seeking competitive quotes if the CH or
BO considers the price to be reasonable. Cardholders should obtain multiple
quotes if they suspect that the price is not reasonable or if buying a
supply/service for which no comparable pricing is readily available. See FAR
13.203(a)(3).</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Funding</strong>. Funds must be committed and obligated prior to purchase.
BOs must ensure that sufficient funds are obligated within the financial system
before providing approval to the CH to make the purchase. CHs must screen the
Purchase Request and Approval document to verify the BO has approved the
requirement to make the purchase. Purchasing before obligation of funds is a
violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act. For CHs who use GFEBS, a purchase request
with sufficient funding must have L4 approval before the card is swiped.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Contract Payments</strong>. If a valid procurement requirement has resulted
in the award of a Government contract, the GPC may be used as a method of
payment against the contract, even if the acquisition would otherwise be for a
GPC prohibited item.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">14-2.</span> Unauthorized Commitments and Ratification</h2>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. An unauthorized commitment (UAC) is defined by FAR 1.602-3(a) as “an
agreement that is not binding solely because the Government representative who
made it lacked the authority to enter into that agreement on behalf of the
Government.” See AFARS 5101.602-3-90. The only individuals who can bind the
Government are warranted contracting officers, ordering officials, and
cardholders acting within the limits of their delegated authority. The
individual making a UAC can be held personally liable to the vendor for the
total cost of supplies or services obtained until the extent of the Government’s
liability is determined. The primary factor in determining whether a purchase is
considered a UAC is contracting authority. CHs have this authority from their
appointment letter. When an individual without contracting authority initiates a
purchase, it is considered a UAC.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. GPC purchases must be approved by the BO prior to purchase and initiated
by the CH. The designated CH is the only person authorized to make purchases
with a GPC. FAR 1.602-3(b) requires agencies to take positive action to preclude
the need for ratification actions. Although procedures are available in cases
where it is necessary to ratify a UAC, these procedures may not be used in a
manner that encourages UACs being made by Government personnel.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. Payment for goods or services accepted in the absence of a UAC may be made
only through the ratification process. Payment cannot be made unless a
Contracting Officer has awarded a contract or an authorized GPC holder acting
within his or her delegation of authority has ordered the item(s).</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Examples of Unauthorized Commitments</strong>.</p>
      <p class="p">1) The Army receives services/supplies in which a properly executed funding
document and an authorized procurement method (e.g., contract, BPA, or GPC) was
not established prior to the Government ordering the services/supplies.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Someone other than the CH contacts a vendor and asks them to provide
supplies or perform work, without the CH’s knowledge and without prior approval
of the billing official.</p>
      <p class="p">3) An individual without contracting authority orders supplies or
services.</p>
      <p class="p">4) CH orders supplies or services exceeding their procurement authority.</p>
      <p class="p">5) A vendor mistakes a request for information as an order, ships the item,
the receiver does not realize it is an improper order and accepts the item
rather than reject and return the item.</p>
      <p class="p">6) A contractor continues to perform a service contract or provide
leased/rented equipment after the expiration date of the contract. This
situation frequently occurs on yearly services/maintenance/lease-type contracts
for which there is a continuing need.</p>
      <p class="p">7) An individual makes a commitment for continuation of services or delivery
of supplies under an expired contract, purchase order, or delivery order.</p>
      <p class="p">8) An individual makes a commitment which exceeds the call order limit on a
blanket purchase agreement.</p>
      <p class="p">9) A person who does not have delegated authority makes a commitment under a
BPA.</p>
      <p class="p">10) An individual makes a commitment which continues contract services over
and above the original scope and dollar amount.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Common Reasons for UACs</strong>.</p>
      <p class="p">1) Failure to plan procurement needs far enough in advance to utilize normal
contracting procedures.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Encountering emergency program requirements and not believing there is
enough time to go through normal procurement procedures.</p>
      <p class="p">3) Failure to expeditiously review, approve, and transmit procurement
requests to the Procurement Office.</p>
      <p class="p">4) Failure to perform extensive market research before taking an action.</p>
      <p class="p">5) Government officials not understanding the parameters of their actual
authority or lack thereof.</p>
      <p class="p">6) Government official not understanding that agreeing to an option presented
by a contractor could be an unauthorized action if it creates more work or
expense.</p>
      <p class="p List1">f. <strong class="ph b">Ratification Process</strong>. AFARS 5101.602-3-90 outlines the Army process
for ratifying an unauthorized commitment. Unauthorized commitments may be paid
by the Army through ratification. Ratification means the act of approving an
unauthorized commitment by an official who has the authority to do so. The
ratification process determines whether the Army or the initiator will pay the
invoice. The individual who made an unauthorized commitment can be held
personally liable to the vendor or the Government for the total cost of supplies
or services obtained until the extent of the Government’s liability is
determined. The Government accepts liability through ratification. When an A/OPC
identifies a potential unauthorized commitment, the A/OPC must contact the local
contracting office to initiate the ratification process. The ratification
authority may be delegated in accordance with agency procedures, but in no case
will the authority be delegated below the level of Chief of the Contracting
office, or equivalent.</p>
      <p class="p List1">g. <strong class="ph b">Payment of Properly Ratified Claims.</strong> A contracting officer can only
ratify the unauthorized commitment if it would have been proper to enter into a
contract before the commitment was made. After the unauthorized commitment is
ratified, the payment of the ratified claim may be made through an appropriate
contract action (e.g., award of a contract, modification to a contract, purchase
order, GPC). After ratification, the GPC may be used to satisfy the commitment
if the amount of payment is within the cardholder’s authority; if the payment is
made in the same fiscal year as the commitment; and if the commitment itself is
properly chargeable to the current fiscal year. If prior fiscal year funds are
required to satisfy the commitment, a purchase order, or other formal
contractual instrument, payable through Government vendor payment channels, will
be required. If the outstanding charges have already been paid in error with the
GPC prior to the discovery of the UAC, the UAC is being processed for
ratification only and the supporting documentation is loaded in the bank’s
EAS.</p>
      <p class="p List1">h. <strong class="ph b">Non-Ratifiable Commitments</strong>. An improper unauthorized commitment is
not ratifiable because it involves violation of a substantive legal requirement
or because the commitment exceeded the Contracting Officer’s authority.</p>
      <p class="p">1) Actions prohibited by law or otherwise improper are considered
non-ratifiable.</p>
      <p class="p">2) The Government is liable for the reasonable value of any goods or services
received by the Government. In such cases, the contracting officer should
document that although the UAC cannot be ratified, the vendor is entitled to
fair and reasonable payment for goods and services accepted (not necessarily the
same amount as the UAC). The contracting officer should resolve the UAC in a
different manner by contacting the mission area finance office.</p>
      <p class="p">3) If it is determined the non-ratifiable commitment should not be paid
(e.g., the Government did not receive and accept services) and/or the vendor
seeks review of a disallowance (in full or in part), the Contracting Officer
should seek legal advice.</p>
      <p class="p">4) FAR 1-602-3(d). Non-ratifiable commitments. Cases that are not ratifiable
under this subsection may be subject to resolution as recommended by the
Government Accountability Office under its claim procedure (GAO Policy and
Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal Agencies, Title 4, Chapter 2), or as
authorized by FAR 50.1. Legal advice should be obtained in these cases.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">14-5.</span> Split Purchases</h2>
   <div class="body conbody">
      
         <p class="p List1">a. A split purchase is the intentional
                  breaking down of a known requirement to stay within a CH’s
                  single purchase limit or the MPT to avoid other procurement
                  methods or competition requirements. Split purchases are
                  prohibited with the GPC (FAR 13.003(c)(2)). Requirements
                  exceeding the MPT should be directed to the contracting
                  office. Cardholders and A/OPCs should check with their legal
                  advisor if unsure whether a proposed purchase would be
                  considered split.</p>
         <p class="p List1">b. The requirement is the total quantity
                  and price known at the time of purchase. If a CH purchases as
                  they become aware of a requirement, the requirement is each
                  purchase. If a CH consolidates purchases and buys once a day,
                  the requirement becomes what was received during that day.</p>
         <p class="p List1">c. Examples of split purchases include,
                  but are not limited to, the following:</p>
      
      <p class="p List2">1) A single CH making multiple purchases
                  from the same merchant on the same day, the total of which
                  exceeds the single purchase limit, and the total requirement
                  was known at the time of the first purchase.</p>
      <p class="p List2">2) A single CH purchasing the same/similar
                  item(s) from multiple merchants on the same day, the total of
                  which exceeds the single purchase limit, and the total was
                  known at the time of the first purchase.</p>
      <p class="p List2">3) A single CH making multiple purchases
                  of similar items from the same or multiple merchants over a
                  period of time when the total requirement was known at time of
                  the first purchase and the value exceeds the single purchase
                  limit.</p>
      <p class="p List2">4) Multiple CHs under the same supervision
                  or BO purchasing the same/similar item(s) the same day or in a
                  compressed timeframe when the total requirement is known at a
                  given time and exceeds the single purchase limit.</p>
      <p class="p List2">5) Requirements exceeding the MPT (e.g.,
                  requirements for monthly recurring services, in which the
                  monthly payment is less than the applicable services MPT, but
                  the known yearly total exceeds the MPT).</p>
      
         <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">What is not a Split Purchase</strong>.
                  Sometimes transactions appear like a split purchase, but they
                  do not meet the definition and are allowable to purchase with
                  the GPC. See common examples below:</p>
         <p class="p List2">1) Multiple purchases to the same vendor
                  which do not exceed the single purchase limit or MPT.
                  <strong class="ph b">Example</strong>. A CH makes two separate $100 purchases from
                  the same vendor on the same day. This situation is not a split
                  purchase because the combined total of $200 is below the
                  MPT.</p>
         <p class="p List1">2) Multiple purchases to the same vendor
                  when the CH purchases as requirements are received.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(a) <strong class="ph b">Example</strong>. A CH receives a $4,000
                  purchase request in the morning. He obtains funding and
                  approval and places the order. In the afternoon, the CH
                  receives an $8,000 purchase request to buy items from the same
                  vendor. He obtains funding and approval and places a second
                  order to the same vendor. This situation is not a split
                  purchase, because the CH was unaware of the second request
                  when he made the initial purchase. Even though the total cost
                  of both purchases exceeded the $10,000 MPT, the total known
                  requirement at the time of each purchase was below the
                  MPT.</p>
         <p class="p">(b) <strong class="ph b">Example</strong>. A CH receives a $6,000 purchase request on Monday. He
obtains funding and approval and places the order. On Wednesday, the CH receives
a purchase request from the same customer to buy additional items from the same
vendor for $5,000. He obtains funding and approval and places a second order to
the same vendor. This situation is not a split purchase, because the CH was
unaware of the second request when he made the initial purchase.</p>

    <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. The servicing bank provides Merchant Authorization Controls (MAC)
            in the form of Merchant Category Codes (MCC) and Merchant Category
            Code Groups (MCCG). MCCs and MCCGs categorize merchants by the goods
            and services they provide. They are used within the servicing bank’s
            card processing system to authorize or decline purchase transactions
            based on controls established for each GPC account. An MCC is a
            four-character numeric code with a corresponding description that
            reflects the merchant’s primary business. An MCCG is a logical
            grouping of MCCs.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Merchant Category Code (MCC)</strong>. A code assigned by the
            merchant’s bank to categorize each merchant according to the type of
            business in which the merchant is engaged and the kinds of supplies
            or services provided. These codes are used as authorized transaction
            codes on a card/account to identify the types of businesses
            providing authorized supplies or services. DPC maintains the list of
            DoD-wide blocked MCC codes. The servicing bank uses MasterCard’s
            Merchant Category Codes (MCCs) to categorize merchants based on the
            types of goods or services they provide. When an A/OPC adds MCCs to
            a Cardholder or Managing Account profile, it enables that specific
            account to make purchases from vendors categorized under that
            MCC.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Tier 1 MCCs</strong>. The servicing bank has placed a hard block on
            merchants with Tier 1 (Very High Risk) MCCs. The bank will decline
            all attempted transactions from vendors with these MCCs. Tier 1 MCCs
            may be unblocked upon approval by the Level 2 A/OPC, on a
            case-by-case basis. All purchases from merchants associated with
            Tier 1 MCCs will generate a data mining case in IOD.</p>

        <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Tier 2 MCCs</strong>. Tier 2 MCCs are considered high risk, and
            their blocking can be customized within the servicing bank. Level 3
            A/OPCs may authorize purchase from vendors with Tier 2 MCCs on a
            case-by-case basis. Purchases from merchants associated with these
            MCCs will not automatically generate a case in IOD. A complete list
            of Tier 1 and 2 MCCs are located at <a class="xref" href="https://extranet.acq.osd.mil/dpap/pdi/pc/FOUO%20-%20DoD%20High-Risk%20MCC%20List_10%2028%2020.docx" target="_blank">DoD Tier 1 and 2 MCC Codes</a>.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">MCC Blocking</strong>. MCC blocking is a designation attached to an
            account, which prevents a specified MCC group from being charged
            (e.g., casinos, pawn shops). The blocking is established by
            attaching a merchant authorization control to a cardholder and/or
            managing account. If authorized MCCs are attached and set to
            approve, then non-authorized MCCs are effectively blocked. If
            non-authorized MCCs are attached and set to decline, then those MCCs
            are blocked and all other MCCs are effectively authorized.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Requests to Override an MCC Block</strong>. When requesting to
            override an MCC block, the CH or BO must provide the following
            information to the A/OPC.</p>
        <p class="p">1) Merchant name and address</p>
        <p class="p">2) Item/service description</p>

        <p class="p">4) Estimated date of the purchase</p>
        <p class="p">5) CH name and last four digits of the card account number</p>
        <p class="p">6) Justification for the purchase</p>
        <p class="p">7) Description of efforts to locate a source other than the merchant
            with the blocked MCC</p>
        <p class="p">8) Blocked MCC, if known</p>
        <p class="p">The Level 4 A/OPC will forward the request to the appropriate
            higher-level A/OPC for approval. Upon approval, the Level 4 A/OPC
            will update the merchant authorization control in the CH account to
            allow the transaction to process. The CH asks the vendor to resubmit
            the charge. After the transaction has processed, the Level 4 A/OPC
            will reapply the merchant authorization control to the CH
            account.</p>
        <p class="p List1">f. <strong class="ph b">Erroneous MCCs</strong>. When a GPC transaction is declined due to
            an erroneously identified code, the CH must contact the servicing
            bank to determine what code is necessary to complete the transaction
            with the declining merchant. The BO and CH should contact the A/OPC
            to discuss a change to the CH’s merchant authorization controls.
            Appropriate authorization is required when Tier 1 or Tier 2 MCC is
            the concern.</p>
