   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p Normal">This AFARS appendix establishes key internal controls for management
            of contracting functions and the method for evaluating the effectiveness of these
            controls. Key internal controls are those controls that must be implemented and
            sustained in daily operations to ensure organizational effectiveness and compliance with
            legal requirements. The use of internal controls is an integral component of an
            organization’s management that provides reasonable assurance for the effectiveness and
            efficiency of operations, reliability of financial reporting, and compliance with laws
            and regulations. </p>
      <p class="p">The purpose of this checklist is to assist Army contracting managers at all levels in
            evaluating the effectiveness of key internal controls for contracting functions
            performed throughout the Army contracting enterprise worldwide. </p>

      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_AppendixBB-102__p_OLE_LINK4">The evaluation of key internal controls should
            result in a specific determination of their effectiveness. Contracting managers shall
            use the checklist questions in appendix BB to test key controls of contracting functions
            through a combination of document analysis, direct observation, and random sampling. The
            annual statement of assurance and supporting documents shall include a corrective action
            plan for deficient answers to checklist questions. The contracting checklist in this
            appendix is not all-inclusive and each contracting activity should supplement the
            checklist with area-specific questions (e.g., major systems, etc.). Formal evaluations
            of key management controls must be conducted at least once every five years (Army
            Regulation 11-2).</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p Normal">Questions in this checklist should be used by office
            chiefs/directors who are deployed into a theater of operations and are supporting
            contingency missions. The term “contingency contracting” means contracting support
            provided in response to a declared contingency operation in accordance with 10 USC
            101(a)(13) (see also FAR subpart 2.1, Definitions). The support may be provided in a
            mature or immature operational environment, and may be long term or short term. Office
            chiefs/directors shall use these questions to test internal controls for contingency
            contracting functions. Each office chief/director shall complete and submit to his/her
            respective senior contracting official (SCO) at the midpoint during the office
            chief/director’s tour. The SCO will provide feedback to the office chief/director
            relating to the effectiveness of key internal controls. Prior to redeployment, the
            office chief/director shall complete and submit a final checklist to the SCO. The final
            checklist will be retained in the continuity book to serve as a baseline for the next
            office chief/director. In addition, information obtained using the checklist will be
            addressed in the SCO’s annual statement of assurance as prescribed by Army Regulation
            11-2.</p>

      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_AppendixBB-204__aGqzHM">c. To ensure advance payments do not result under an “other transaction” with cost reimbursable features, does the “other transaction” require the contractor to submit a report of actual expenditures as a condition for milestone payment? Does the “other transaction” stipulate that the milestone payment will not exceed actual expenditures?</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_AppendixBB-204__nQkFob">d. When an “other transaction” has firm-fixed price characteristics with payable milestone provisions, are the payable milestone values commensurate with the estimated value of the milestone events?</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_AppendixBB-204__hzqUAL">e. When an “other transaction” requires the submittal of technical, business or annual report, has the agreements officer considered whether these reports are important enough to warrant establishment of separate milestones, or if report requirements should be incorporated as part of a larger payable milestone?</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_AppendixBB-204__mdsBVz">f. Does the “other transaction” require the delivery of technical reports to the Defense Technology Information Center, upon completion of the research and engineering project (DoD Instruction 3200.14)?</p>

      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_AppendixBB-204__VQiXOa">a. If a TIA provides for payment to be made based on payable milestones, are these payable milestones based on observable, technical progress?</p>

At the completion of each payable milestone or upon receipt of the quarterly business status report, has the agreements officer compared the total amount of project expenditures with the amount of payments for completed milestones?
