      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-1__lMnZbJ">a. Requiring activities must perform acquisition planning to: consider strategic sourcing vehicles; identify procurement needs; and initiate procurement actions with sufficient lead time to buy appropriate products at the right price from the right suppliers in a timely manner. Requirements and logistics personnel should avoid issuing requirements on an urgent basis or with unrealistic delivery or performance schedules, since it generally restricts competition and increases prices.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-1__uRsoHp">b. CHs should consider small businesses and installation AbilityOne Base Supply Centers to the maximum extent practicable, when making micro-purchases to increase their participation when using the GPC below the micro-purchase threshold.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-1__EAVdhQ">c. Purchase requirements exceeding the micro-purchase threshold must be referred to a contracting office for formal contracting action. Splitting requirements into smaller parts to avoid formal contracting procedures, competition requirements, or to keep spending limitations under the micro-purchase threshold is prohibited. GPC micro-purchases should be distributed equitably among qualified suppliers, in accordance with FAR 13.202(a)(1), with special consideration paid to supporting your installation AbilityOne Base Supply Center, and local, small, and small disadvantaged businesses. When purchasing from FSSs and BPAs, cardholders must review prices on at least three contracts/agreements, unless it is a competitively awarded BPA and select the best value item for their requirements.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-1__SiRdjL">d. CHs who receive authorization and training from their Level 4 A/OPC may use the GPC to make commercial purchases up to $25,000 if the CH making the purchase is located outside the United States and the purchase is for use outside the United States (OCONUS). CH’s must use mandatory sources identified in this regulation (e.g. FAR Part 8, DOD EMALL for office supplies), before deciding to use outside commercial vendors. For the use of the GPC outside the United States, CHs must follow policy in accordance with DFARS 213.301(2).</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-1__p_OLE_LINK22">e. OCONUS Units. For CONUS purchases for use overseas, the CH must contact their local Director of Logistics Traffic Management Office for assistance regarding transportation and packaging requirements and/or instructions prior to contacting the vendor. CHs must ensure the final price includes all costs associated with the mode of transportation and packaging selected to the destination country, customs import duties, and any other charges that may accrue. Consult DOD Directive 4500.54-E, DOD Foreign Clearance Program (FCP) prior to the requisitioning action to ensure compliance with host nation customs requirements.</p>

The GPC may be used as a method of payment (MOP) for simplified acquisitions and contracts in accordance with DFARS 213.301, AFARS 5113.202-90 and 5113.270-90. An individual authorized as an Army ordering officer, and other designated contracting personnel may use the purchase card as a method of payment up to the limit as identified in the contract; under the supervision of the contracting officer or from Army contracts that, by their terms, expressly allow Army ordering officers to place orders and pay with the GPC as identified in AFARS 5113.202-90.

      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-5__p__Toc147113860">a. Specific guidance on use of required sources and order of precedence of sources is prescribed in FAR, Part 8, and DFARS, Part 208, e.g., National Industries for the Blind (NIB), National Industries for the Severely Disabled (NISH), Federal Prison Industries (a.k.a. UNICOR), and FSS/GSA schedule requirements. In addition to those mandatory sources listed in FAR Part 8, cardholders should strongly consider using small and small disadvantaged businesses whenever possible. The AbilityOne Program is a mandatory source of supply, with any procurement method and at any dollar value, in compliance with the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled statute, (41 U.S.C. §8501-8506). The AbilityOne Program's mandatory status remains in effect for all purchases--including those under the micro-purchase threshold. A full line of AbilityOne products can be found at your local installation AbilityOne Base Supply Center, DOD EMALL Army Corridor, and through AbilityOne.com where installation agreements do not exist for Base Supply Centers.</p>

In accordance with AFARS 5139.101-90(a), Computer Hardware, Enterprise Software and Solution (CHESS) is the Army’s mandatory source for commercial Information Technology (IT) hardware and software purchases. CHESS, accessible at <a class="xref" href="https://chess.army.mil" target="_blank">
            <u class="ph u">https://chess.army.mil</u>
         </a>, is a set of multiple award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts that offer IT products and services that comply with NETCOM, Army and DoD policy and standards. Cardholders must utilize CHESS contracts and DoD enterprise software agreements first regardless of dollar value. Any purchase made outside of the CHESS contracts requires a waiver. The waiver process is located at <a class="xref" href="https://chess.army.mil" target="_blank">
            <u class="ph u">https://chess.army.mil</u>
         </a>. Waivers are granted when products are unavailable on CHESS contracts or when hardware and software is available at a lower price from an alternate source. A CHESS waiver does not constitute approval to purchase any product or deviate from any other Army regulation or policy. Individual waivers are approved by CHESS and Army organization/activity blanket waivers are approved by the Army Chief Information Officer (CIO)/G-6. There is no fee associated with using CHESS and cardholders should maximize the use of discounts when ordering off CHESS contracts.</p>
      <p class="p" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-5__Frmmtj">If no small business capability exists, CHESS contract vehicles are the preferred source for acquisition of IT services. Waivers from CHESS are not required when procuring IT services. However, if IT Hardware and Software are required as part of a non-CHESS IT services contract, a waiver for the hardware and software is required.</p>
      <p class="p Text Body" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-5__p_OLE_LINK12">c. Green procurement is the purchase of environmentally preferable products and services (see FAR 23.202, 23.403, and 23.703). The Army Green Procurement Policy Memorandum, dated 22 Nov 06, established the Army Green Procurement Program (GPP) policy that “All Army personnel must comply with green procurement requirements to facilitate attainment of the DOD goal of 100% compliance with mandatory Federal purchasing preference programs” (see AR 70-1). The Army Green Procurement Guide provides an overview of the Federal procurement preference programs and guidance on implementing an effective GPP including A/OPC and cardholder responsibilities. A copy of the guide can be found at: <a class="xref" href="http://www.garrison.hawaii.army.mil/sustainability/Documents/SustAcquisition/ArmyGreenProcurementGuide.pdf" target="_blank">

         </a>.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-5__UnsGiV">(1) Training on GPP requirements should be conducted when cards are issued and on a recurring basis to provide updates and remind buyers of responsibilities and procedures. The Level 3/4 A/OPC should ensure that initial card training includes a module on green procurement, particularly the mandatory GPP requirements. Green procurement training is available from sources found in the Army Green Procurement Guide.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-5__FUDtBd">(2) The Level 4 A/OPC is responsible for ensuring GPP compliance and documenting noncompliance on the semi-annual surveillance report.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-5__UjfgGB">(3) Cardholders must show preference to recycled content and biobased products whenever they are cost effective and meet technical requirements. Installations must consider environmental factors in all purchasing decisions and give preference to those products and services designated by or recommended in Federal green purchasing preference programs.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-5__ZLteCk">(4) Per the National Defense Authorization Act of 1998, as of January 1, 2004, paper purchased using the GPC must be 50% post-consumer recycled paper.

      <span class="ph autonumber">3-6.</span> Separation of Duties</h2>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-6__TCtPsH">a. OMB standards for internal controls require that key duties and responsibilities be divided or segregated among individuals to ensure they do not exceed or abuse their assigned authority, OMB Circular A-123, Appendix B Revised, paragraph 4.3. Separation of duties is an internal control activity, intended to provide checks and balances to the GPC process, to prevent or minimize innocent errors or intentional fraud occurring without detection. This is done by ensuring that no single individual has control over multiple phases of a purchase card transaction. To protect the integrity of the procurement process, no one person is responsible for an entire purchase card transaction. Key purchase card functions must be handled by different individuals. Inadequate separation of duties could allow errors and fraud to occur without detection. Key duties, such as making purchases–CH, authorizing payments–BO, certifying funding–RM, and reviewing transactions–Level 4 A/OPCs and PBOs must be assigned to different individuals in order to minimize the risk of loss to the Government to the greatest extent possible.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-6__NozBPx">b. If resource constraints prevent assignment of the key duties to different individuals, as set forth in paragraph (a) above, the activity must request a waiver through the Level 4 A/OPC and the CCO to the Level 3 A/OPC for approval, and will require additional surveillance.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-6__wPEOBn">c. Notwithstanding the above-described waiver process, certain key duties must not be assigned to the same individual. In no case shall the same individual be the CH and the BO for a GPC account. In no case shall the CCO, Property Book Officer, or any Level 4 A/OPC (primary or alternate) also be a CH, BO or contracting officer who is making contract payments with a GPC or executing GPC purchases. A CH, who is a hand receipt holder, should not purchase property for their own use. PCOLS provides the functionality to generate a report identifying potential conflicts of interest in GPC Program duties.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">3-7.</span> Span of Control</h2>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-7__QExBUq">a. The Army standard for span of control for a Level 4 A/OPC is 300 accounts. This number includes both BO and CH accounts. A ratio of not more than seven card accounts to an A/BO is the Army standard. Ensuring a reasonable number of card accounts are assigned to each A/BO or Certifying Officer account is paramount to the effective accomplishment of the A/BO or Certifying Officer’s responsibilities. The total number of transactions, as well as the number of assigned card accounts, must be considered when determining an acceptable account-to-A/BO ratio. Span of control refers to the extent of oversight and review responsibilities placed on a single A/OPC or BO. An appropriate span of control must efficiently and effectively allow the A/OPC or BO to provide reasonable assurance they can effectively perform their responsibilities regardless of the number of accounts assigned. The assigned span of control must factor in a Level 4 A/OPC’s responsibility to conduct an annual review of all BO accounts including semi-annual surveillance of 25% of all transactions under his/her oversight. A span of control too large may preclude the A/OPC from accomplishing this task effectively and efficiently.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-7__CoyjKx">b. When the number of accounts (300:1 accounts per A/OPC) or workload complexity/administration assigned to a Level 4 A/OPC exceeds the Army standard, the SCO and the CCO must ensure adequate resources are made available to allow the Level 4 A/OPC’s successful performance of his or her duties. When the span of control exceeds the Army standard by more than 10 percent and the CCO elects not to provide additional resources, the CCO must provide the SCO with formal documentation stating that the CCO has personally reviewed the existing span of control and has determined the span of control is adequate to ensure program administration and surveillance can be performed at a satisfactory level. The Level 3 A/OPC must retain a copy of this documentation.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-7__CayLdw">c. When the ratio for CH accounts to BOs exceeds the Army standard, the BO shall prepare a request for a waiver to policy. The approval levels for waivers are indicated in paragraph 3-7e. The total number of transactions as well as the number of assigned CH accounts must be considered when determining an acceptable card and/or checking account-to-BO ratio.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-7__tXzhYw">d. Upon the nomination and approval of a prospective CH and during the annual review of BO accounts, the Level 4 A/OPCs determines if the span of control is acceptable—that is, whether the BO can reasonably be expected to complete a thorough review of all transactions and certify the invoice within five business days of its receipt.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-7__aGUSlZ">e. The Level 4 A/OPC documents all cases where the CH-to-Billing Official ratio exceeds the Army standard. In these cases, the BO prepares a request for a waiver to policy. The request must address the unique conditions that affect the process and show, with a high degree of certainty, that the BO can be expected to comply with the review and certification procedures. The request must include the number and location of assigned CHs, the total average number of transactions made by the CHs, the amount of time the BO can devote to the certification process, the history of delinquencies, and other factors that seem appropriate. The waiver is approved at the following level indicated below and maintained by the approver with copies furnished to the BO:</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-7__tEDpMH">(1) 8–10 CHs accounts: Through the Level 4 A/OPC to the CCO.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-7__BnDsoh">(2) 11–19 CHs accounts: Through the A/OPC (Level 4 and Level 3) to the SCO.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-9__YKOEWK">a. Surcharges are fees that a retailer adds to the cost of a purchase when a customer uses a charge/credit card. As a result of the settlement between a class of retailers and the brands, on January 27, 2013, merchants in the United States and U.S. Territories are permitted to impose a surcharge on cardholders when a charge/credit card is used.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-9__GqBtaY">b. Not all merchants impose a surcharge, and some states (California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Oklahoma and Texas) have laws which do not allow or limit surcharges. Cardholders who receive a surcharge or a check out fee in any of the above mentioned states should report the merchant to the state Attorney General’s Office.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-9__mIvrRY">c. Surcharges may not be added to debit, prepaid or cash purchases and cardholders are required to be notified in advance of making the purchase if a merchant will impose a surcharge. Merchants must also include the surcharge fee on any receipt(s) provided to the cardholder.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-9__TcwPCl">d. Per Visa and MasterCard guidance, there is a limit to the allowable surcharge amounts. These limits vary by brand and by merchant discount rate. Information on surcharge limitations for Visa and MasterCard is available at:</p>

      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-9__uLFUlo">e. A/OPCs should ensure cardholders and other charge card management personnel are aware of the possibility of surcharges when making purchases using credit/charge cards. If a merchant is imposing a surcharge, the cardholder should consider choosing another merchant that offers the same or similar item(s) to avoid paying the surcharge.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-11__p_OLE_LINK16">a. The CH reconciles the statement of account throughout the month by reviewing it for accuracy and comparing it with his or her purchase log entries. If the statement is correct, the CH approves it within three business days from the end of the billing cycle. If the statement is incorrect, the CH must contact the merchant and request correction. If the merchant does not cooperate or provide the ordered goods and services, the CH disputes the incorrect transaction.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-11__dEFVdG">b. The BO must ensure GPC transactions are legal, proper, and correct in accordance with Government rules and regulations. If the billing statement is correct following the BO’s review throughout the month, certification of the billing statement is done within five business days from the end of the billing cycle. If the BO finds questionable transactions, the CH must be contacted to review supporting documentation. If the BO determines the CH is negligent, the BO takes appropriate action in accordance with DOD and Army policy, and informs the Level 4 A/OPC of the action taken. Disputes must be filed by one of three methods: calling the Servicing Bank, faxing over a Cardholder Statement of Questioned Items form or using the Servicing Bank’s dispute process in AXOL, within 60 days of the cycle end date in which the transaction appeared in order to retain the Government’s dispute rights.</p>

This procedure has been called “Confirm and Pay”. Each BO must establish a system to flag and track all transactions certified for payment with proof of receipt and acceptance. This procedure ensures all transactions reconciled and approved for payment have receipt verified.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-12__WLBUWI">b. Under the following condition, the Army has adopted the following process in order to allow the Servicing Bank to be paid for items that have been shipped by the merchant but not received by the organization to prevent withholding payment of the entire billing statement for a few transactions. Transactions that have been reconciled and approved for payment will have receipt verified no later than 45 days after the date of the original invoice.

The approving or certifying official maintains certified billing statements and supporting documents for six years and three months in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), General Records Schedule (GRS) 6, “Accountable Officers’ Accounts Records”. See DOD FMR Volume 15, Chapter 6 for additional information on document retention for accountable officers’ records (10 years from the date of case closure for Foreign Military Sales).</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-13__GZAkjP">b. All financial records, both paper and electronic, must be retained documenting the GPC transactions in a file to include (1) the BO statement, (2) the CH statement, and (3) all original receipts and documentation for those statements.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-13__p_OLE_LINK10">c. Receipts are considered supporting documents for the certified billing statement and in accordance with the DOD FMR, Volume 1, Chapter 9, must be retained for six years and three months after final payment. Original receipts are preferred; however, printed electronic forms or copies of an itemized receipt are acceptable. The receipt must be legible; goods must be itemized/detailed with the item description, quantity, price, and extended price; indicate vendor’s name and address; date of the purchase; and must indicate paid by credit card or zero amount due. The BO maintains these records, either physically in his/her physical possession, or when appropriate transfers to a records holding area. However, if certifying electronically, the CH and BO may rely on the Servicing Bank recordkeeping for the BO and CH statements. Original records are the property of the U.S. Government and may not be removed from government control by the BO for any reason.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-13__mSeddJ">d. Level 4 A/OPCs shall retain hard copy file documentation for Government credit card files documenting application for cards and approval, account maintenance, letters of GPC delegation (CH or BO), ethics certification (if applicable), required training certifications, results of annual reviews, and related information for three years after the fiscal year in which the card account is cancelled.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-13__HogeQA">e. Documents received and/or generated by the cardholder to support transactions shall be retained for six years and three months after final payment. Data residing in the bank’s electronic access system is maintained by the bank for six years and three months.

Reports covering data for periods beyond the previous two years are available from the Bank upon request.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">3-14.</span> Convenience Checks and Foreign Draft Checks</h2>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__xshUjw">a. Convenience checks and Foreign Draft Checks (FDCs) provide activities with the flexibility to issue checks for payment of supplies and services. With the exception of contingencies, convenience checks shall not be written over the micro-purchase threshold. Convenience checks are issued for domestic purchases valued in U.S. dollars when the merchant does not accept the GPC. DOD activities have the flexibility to issue convenience checks to pay for products and services at the activity level. FDCs are issued for overseas purchases valued in foreign currency when the merchant does not accept the GPC. The following requirements apply to one or both of these financial instruments as specified.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__bSwhIR">b. The CH shall not use a convenience check or FDC unless its use is considered advantageous to the activity after evaluating all alternative methods of purchase. Convenience checks and FDCs may not be used to avoid the normal GPC payment process. Before a check is issued, the paying agency must make every effort to use the GPC, including making maximum efforts to find and use merchants that accept the GPC. The authority to maintain a checkbook shall be justified on an individual organization basis and controlled and monitored by the organization’s CCO. The number of checkbooks per installation must be kept to a minimum. A delegation of procurement authority is granted in writing by the CCO for the maintenance and use of convenience checks.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__ZrACMc">c. Convenience checkbook accounts are available only to organizations that maintain active GPC accounts in good standing. A convenience checkbook holder may have a GPC account and a separate convenience checkbook account. Convenience checks are pre-numbered, and their use is controlled with a separate convenience check purchase log for each account. Checkbook holder shall maintain original voided checks.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__iCsIMh">d. Convenience checks and FDCs are not issued for more than the micro-purchase threshold (or the foreign currency equivalent), and must be issued for the exact payment amount. In the case of an FDC, the payment amount includes the administrative processing fee. However, in the case of convenience checks, the payment amount does not include the administrative processing fee. The convenience check processing fee is added by the servicing bank during processing of the transaction, and the addition of the processing fee is not considered a split requirement. “Splitting” payment amounts across more than one convenience check or FDC to keep the purchase amount per check below the micro-purchase threshold limit is prohibited. Convenience checks and FDCs will not be issued as an “exchange-for-cash” vehicle to establish cash funds. If merchants issue credit or refunds by cash or check, the funds must be immediately credited to the account against which the purchase was originally made.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__rfjIEp">e. Convenience checks and FDCs are negotiable instruments and must be stored in a locked container, such as a safe or locking filing cabinet. Checks must be accounted for appropriately to prevent loss, theft, or potential forgery. Convenience check and FDC accounts must be reviewed quarterly by a disinterested party and not the A/OPC. The checks are reconciled just as other GPC transactions, as a part of the monthly statement billing cycle. Copies of voided checks must be retained through the carbon copy or photocopy the original check as a part of the account-holder's original documentation files.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__EHLYVf">f. The same purchase prohibitions that apply to the GPC apply to the convenience check and the FDC.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__FrZbzw">g. The normal dispute process associated with the GPC is not applicable to convenience checks and FDCs. Any concerns over a purchase made with a check must be resolved directly with the merchant. The check writer is solely responsible for securing credit or disputing purchases with the merchant. Each organization is responsible for all checks written on an account; unless it is determined fraud is involved (see Section 4-5 on fraud). In some cases, payment can be stopped on a convenience check that has been written if the check has not yet been posted to an account. To stop payment on a check, the check-writer must call the Servicing Bank’s Customer Service Department to receive instructions on processing the action.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__fprbou">h. FDC accounts are established in the contracting office. Customer activities desiring FDC accounts outside the contracting office must justify, in writing, to the CCO why an account is necessary. FDC BOs, cashiers, and custodians must receive standard GPC training prior to being issued active FDC accounts.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__EMCumm">i. The check cashier is the only person who has the authority to issue and sign checks. He or she may hold a GPC account in addition to the convenience check FDC account, as long as the accounts are maintained separately.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__LmKCJu">j. The check custodian orders, receives, stores, issues, inventories, reconciles, and disposes of FDC stock. He or she is not responsible for approving and processing requirements for check writing.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__HFjUZN">k. The BO authorizes and certifies the issuance of FDCs written by the cashier. In order to maintain effective internal controls, the BO may not perform the check-writing and maintenance functions of the cashier and custodian. All convenience checks and FDCs must be reconciled as a part of the monthly billing statement at the end of the billing cycle.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__SrjGai">l. Establishing Convenience Check Accounts. Any U.S. Government employee, military or civilian, including local national employees, may be selected for appointment as a check writer. Contractors working for the Army must not to be selected for appointment. Requests to establish convenience check accounts must be justified in writing by the organization’s Commander/Director and forwarded to the Level 4 A/OPC. If approved, a delegation of procurement authority is granted in writing by the CCO, for the maintenanceand use of convenience checks. Required information must consist of the following:</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__geiYIf">(1) Reason for requesting checks</p>

      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__fLkdsu">m. Use of Convenience Check Accounts.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__OPDtja">(1) Convenience checks may be used for small purchases, when supplies or service are available for delivery within 15 days whether at the contractor’s place of business or at destination. Convenience checks must not be used for employee reimbursements, cash advances, cash awards, travel-related transportation payments, or meals. Purchases made with the check must not require detailed specifications or an inspection report. Convenience checks should not be used for recurring payments.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__niSMFw">(2) Convenience checks may be used for purposes not related to small purchases when such expenditures are authorized by other regulations such as:</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__lQDmjz">(a) Delivery charges associated with the purchases made with a convenience check when the contractor is requesting to arrange delivery. These charges include local delivery, parcel post including cash on delivery (COD) postal charges, and line haul or inter-city transportation charges, provided the charges are determined in the best interest of the Government.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__gPepIS">(b) C.O.D. charges for supplies ordered for payment with a convenience check upon delivery.</p>
      <p class="p" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__PiOUnd">n.Tax Reporting - The 1099 Tax Reporting Process (TRP) was developed to collect convenience checks written for services, rent, medical and health care services and other Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requirements. This data is used to process IRS 1099-MISC forms. The BO is responsible to monitor the check writer's compliance with 1099-TRP.</p>
      <p class="p" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__NAUNvc">(1) Convenience check holders must submit check data to DFAS on any checks they issue for tax reportable categories. This should be done throughout the year and is suggested to be completed monthly, and can be done on-line once the check writer and their corresponding A/OPC officially request access to the 1099 TRP.

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-15__celqVc">The Army must satisfy requirements for supplies and services from or through the sources and publications listed in the descending order of priority in FAR Part 8.002. The Office Supply BPAs fall under mandatory Federal supply schedules and must be utilized for office supply purchases unless an exception applies. The Office Supply BPAs can be accessed through the Army Corridor of the DOD EMALL site: <a class="xref" href="https://dod-emall.dla.mil/acct/" target="_blank">
            <u class="ph u">https://dod-emall.dla.mil/acct/</u>
         </a>. The primary goals of the Office Supply BPAs are to ensure that office product purchases are in compliance with the statutory preferences afforded to products manufactured under the AbilityOne Program, capture economies of scale, and realize significant savings while providing opportunities for small business. Exceptions to the mandatory use of the BPAs and DOD EMALL are as follows:</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-15__IRQfTO">(1) This policy does not apply to purchases made Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS).</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-15__BGIlgn">(2) Purchases made directly from AbilityOne or from AbilityOne Base Supply Centers (BSCs). Cardholders may purchase office and cleaning supplies directly from AbilityOne Base Supply Centers and are exempt from using the Office Supply BPAs. These products are available at Base Supply Centers on military installations or in federal buildings.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-15__FXqWNE">(3) Cardholders may purchase National Stock Number (NSN) items directly from AbilityOne BSCs and are exempt from using the Standard Army Retail Supply System (SARSS) or the Office Supply BPAs. When NSN products are not available from the BSCs, then cardholders should use the SARSS to purchase NSN Products.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-15__PqbZKX">(4) <span class="ph">Purchases made from wholesale supply sources such as stock programs of the General Services Administration</span> (e.g. GSA Global Supply Center).</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-15__jYfRbG">(5) Cardholders may purchase an item from another source if an urgent need exists for an unplanned requirement needed for the same day. Poor acquisition planning and inadequate market research would not apply to this exception. Use of this exception requires valid documentation and retention in the purchase card file.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-15__KLoIWt">(6) NAFI cardholders must comply with the required sources (see paragraph 3-5). When purchasing office supplies, NAFI GPC cardholders shall consider the AbilityOne Base Supply Centers or the Office Supply BPAs on the DOD EMALL Army Corridor as a practical choice. If it is not in the best interest of the NAFI to purchase through AbilityOne Base Supply Centers or the Office Supply BPAs, the cardholder may consider other required sources. The cardholder must adequately document the decision to not purchase from the AbilityOne Base Supply Centers or the Office Supply BPAs before an open-market source can be considered.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-15__etRgli">(7) In the event the DoD EMALL is unavailable for more than 24 hours, cardholders may place orders with the Office Supply BPA vendor through another form of communication.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">3-16.</span> Rebates/Credits</h2>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-16__hSgyck">a. Rebates are posted as credits against billing statements and applied at the billing statement level unless specified otherwise by the Level 2 A/OPC. Rebates are automatically assigned to the default line of accounting (LOA) on the billing statement. BOs should reallocate the rebates across various LOAs (of the same appropriation) to the extent that no single LOA has a credit balance. Under no circumstance will the CH retain gift checks, vendor rebates or other purchase incentives that can be converted to personal use. If received, these items must be turned over to the U.S. Treasury.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-16__zyMrfm">b. Unless specific authority exists allowing rebates to be used for other purposes, rebates must be returned to the appropriation or account from which they were expended, and can be used for any legitimate purchase by the appropriation or account to which they were returned, or as otherwise authorized by statute.</p>
      <p class="p" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-16__MiokhY">c. Credit transactions are posted as credits against billing statements, applied at the billing statement level. When a closed account carries a credit balance the amount shall be sent via check to the Level 4 A/OPC. The check will be addressed to US Government or US Treasury. The Level 4 A/OPC shall work with his/her RM in identifying an account and in determining how the credit is distributed within the installation.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-16__rABkRd">d. Reimbursements such as rebates, merchant credits, or other credits attributable to accounts closed during the quarter or accounts not having enough purchases to offset the credit, require the Servicing Bank to issue quarterly checks to the Level 4 A/OPC. Merchant credits must be applied back to the funding appropriation. Rebates must be used in the fiscal year they are received.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-16__hTjmgr">e. Each Level 4 A/OPC is directed to deliver all reimbursement check(s) to their RM within five (5) days of receipt, retain a copy of each reimbursement check(s), and obtain the RM's signature acknowledging their receipt and acceptance of the reimbursement check(s). The CH, BO, and RM should have a process to ensure adequate controls are in place to track credits and rebates. Questions related to reimbursements in the form of a rebate, merchant credit, or other credit should be directed to your local RM. CHs must forward their monthly cardholder statement to the BO with the appropriate supporting documentation, within 5 working days, to maximize rebates and minimize prompt payment penalties.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-16__qzjspf">f. Rebate policy guidance is available in the DOD FMR Volume 10 Chapter 2, OMB Circular A-123 Appendix B Chapter 7, and DOD Charge Card Guidebook Appendix K paragraph 13.</p>
