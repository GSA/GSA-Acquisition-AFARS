CHESS contracts provide IT products and services that comply with U.S. Army Network Enterprise Technology Command, Army and DoD policy and standards.  Purchasers of commercial hardware and software must satisfy their IT requirements by utilizing the Joint and Enterprise License Agreements (J/ELA), DoD Enterprise Software Initiative (ESI) agreements, and/or CHESS contracts first, regardless of dollar value or financial appropiation.  Additionally, purchasers of IT requirements through a third party such as a system integrator must ensure solicitations and contract vehicles include the requirement to purchase through the CHESS and the DoD ESI agreements.</p>
      <p class="p List2">(2) Any IT hardware or software purchase made outside of the CHESS contracts requires an Army Deputy Chief of Staff (DCS), G-6 approved ITAS Approval, unless the purchase meets one of the exceptions in paragraph (a)(3). The ITAS Approval along with supporting documentation shall be part of the procurement package submitted to the Contracting officer and shall also be part of the resulting solicitation and contract file(s). Supporting documentation must include documentation submitted with the ITAS Approval request such as a CHESS Statement of Non-Availability (SONA) for items that are not available from CHESS or other rationale for not using CHESS. The CHESS website located at http://chess.army.mil provides a complete list of CHESS contracts, the DoD ESI as well as information concerning ITAS Approvals and CHESS SONAs.
