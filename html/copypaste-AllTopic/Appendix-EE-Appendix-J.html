Sensitive items require a high degree of protection and control due to statutory requirements or regulations, such as narcotics and drug abuse items; precious metals; items which are of a high value, highly technical, or a hazardous nature; and small arms, ammunition, explosives, and demolition material or classified (See Volume 10, Table 61 of DOD 4100.39-M reference (k)). Additional and/or separate records or other record keeping instruments shall be established for management purposes, or when otherwise required by law, policy, regulation, or agency direction, including, but not limited to pilferable items. Pilferable items have a ready resale value or application to personal possession and are, therefore, especially subject to theft.
