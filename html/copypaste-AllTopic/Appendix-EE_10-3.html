   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. IRS requires DoD federal agencies to report convenience check payments as
income. See 26 USC 6041, 6041A, and 6045. IRS Form 1099 must be issued to check
recipients for certain payment types. (Refer to <a class="xref" href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1099msc.pdf" target="_blank">IRS Instructions for Form 1099 - MISC</a> for more detail
regarding payment types that are not reportable to DFAS.) Convenience check data
must be reported to the IRS as income to the check recipients. IRS matches the
reported data to the check recipients’ tax returns to ensure income is
reported.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Tax Reporting</strong>. The DFAS Tax Office emails convenience check
purchasing data to the checkwriters for verification on a monthly basis. The
email contains a spreadsheet, instructions, and the suspense date for return.

and email the spreadsheet to the following mailbox: <a class="xref" href="mailto:dfas.cco-checks@mail.mil" target="_blank">DFAS 1099 Check Writer Reporting</a> within five business
days upon receipt. This data is used to process IRS 1099-MISC forms. The BO is
responsible to monitor the checkwriter's compliance. BOs and checkwriters who do
not return the requested information to DFAS are responsible for their own tax
form issuance and IRS tax reporting. Instructions for submitting convenience
check 1099 tax reporting information is available on the <a class="xref" href="https://www.dfas.mil/contractorsvendors/taxinfo/Convenience-Check-1099PRO/" target="_blank">DFAS Office Website</a>.</p>
