      <p> </p>
      <p outputclass="List7">(<i>iv</i>) The contracting officer must send the report not later than
         20 days after the Government Accountability Office (GAO) notifies the agency by telephone
         that a protest has been filed. If the GAO decides to use the express option and the
         contracting officer concludes that the report cannot be furnished in time, he/she must
         notify the appropriate office in (<i>i</i>)-(<i>iii</i>) at once so that it may request an
         extension from GAO.</p>
      <p outputclass="List6">(<i>2</i>) Before forwarding the report to the GAO Comptroller General,
         the addressees in paragraphs (a)(3)(i)(<i>1</i>)(<i>i</i>)-(<i>iii</i>) of this section
         must review the report and recommend any changes required to ensure that the report is
         accurate, complete, and legally sufficient.</p>

      <p outputclass="List2">(1)(A) The contracting officer must prepare a determination and
         findings (D&amp;F) for HCA concurrence when it is necessary to request authorization to
         award a contract notwithstanding a protest. The D&amp;F must clearly address –</p>
      <p outputclass="List6">(<i>1</i>) Whether significant adverse consequences will necessarily
         occur if the stay is not overridden;</p>
      <p outputclass="List6">(<i>2</i>) Whether reasonable alternatives to the override exist that
         would adequately address the circumstances presented;</p>
      <p outputclass="List6">(<i>3</i>) How the potential costs of proceeding with the override,
         including the costs associated with the potential that GAO might sustain the protest,
         compare to the benefits associated with the approach being considered for addressing the
         agency’s needs; and</p>
      <p outputclass="List6">(<i>4</i>) The impact of the override on competition and the integrity
         of the procurement system.</p>
      <p outputclass="List4">(B) The contracting officer must have approval from the Deputy
         Assistant Secretary of the Army (Procurement) (DASA(P)) prior to any award or selection,
         except for contracting offices reporting to AMC,where the HCA provides approval . The
         contracting officer must also prepare a request for approval that identifies all protest
         issues and addresses the merits and expected resolution of the protest. Include details of
         any congressional interest in the protest. After legal review, the HQAMC, Office of Command
         Counsel, will forward the request, with the D&amp;F, in accordance with agency procedures
         to the HCA. (See Override of Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) Stays: A Guidebook,
