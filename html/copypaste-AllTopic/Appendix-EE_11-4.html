        <p class="p">DM case reviews enable documentation of any identified findings and
            corrective actions taken. DM case reviews include both
            system-generated cases and manually-added cases, which may be opened
            at management’s discretion. Cases must be opened for each finding
            and disciplinary category determination independently identified
            during compliance reviews. Monthly A/OPC Reviews are conducted to
            promote and measure compliance with purchasing and management
            internal controls and provide reasonable assurance of the
            effectiveness of these controls to mitigate program risk.
            Semi-Annual HA Reviews are conducted to ensure adherence to internal
            controls and facilitate senior management’s awareness of their GPC
            program’s health, and to help them promote the interdisciplinary
            communication necessary for successful GPC program operations. The
            use of an automated data mining system enables the Army to fulfill
            the 10 USC 4754 requirement to “use effective systems, techniques,
            and technologies to prevent or identify improper purchases.”</p>

        <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">DM Case Management.</strong> Oversight Systems’
            IOD DM capability evaluates each transaction against a set of tiered
            business rules to identify high-risk transactions. Tier 1 rules are
            mandatory and applicable to all DoD purchase cards. Tier 2 rules are
            mandatory rules that can be tailored as necessary at the local
            level. DM cases can be system-generated or manually generated. The
            system generates a DM case whenever a business rule is broken. GPC
            program officials are required to manually create cases for each
            finding and disciplinary category determination they independently
            identify during their reviews. Each case is adjudicated to determine
            if the transaction is to be classified under one of five
            disciplinary categories standardized in compliance with the DPC memo
            “Final Governmentwide Commercial Purchase Card Disciplinary Category
            Definitions Guidance,” January 27, 2020. Disputes are also
            categorized as determinations.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Tier 2 Tailoring</strong>. Tier 2 business
            rules are tailorable to the cardholder level to meet the Army’s
            organizational needs. Tailoring must be consistent with requirements
            in the DoD Charge Card Guidebook. As part of the SAHAR process,
            Heads of Activity (HAs) are required to validate that any Tier 2
            Tailoring of DM business rules are implemented appropriately. For
            more information, refer to GPC one-pager 3OP034, “Tier 2 Tailoring
            in Insights on Demand (IOD)” on the DPC GPC website. To properly
            manage program risk for these potentially high-risk transactions,
            IOD automatically selects a random sample of 1% of these Tier 2
            “auto closed” cases and assigns them for adjudication (“1% Random
            Reopen”). The IST reviews Tier 2 Tailoring data sets and trends and
            considers methodology changes based on its findings.</p>

            Process</strong>.</p>
        <p class="p" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_11-4__Toc101163568">1) When a transaction is flagged for review, IOD
            generates a case and assigns it to the primary BO. </p>
        <p class="p" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_11-4__Toc101163570">2) The BO reviews the CH’s file documentation in
            the bank’s EAS. The BO then locates the case in IOD and inputs
            requested data. </p>
        <p class="p">3) Once the BO has submitted their review, IOD assigns the case to
            the Level 4 A/OPC. The Level 4 A/OPC reviews the CH’s file
            documentation, inputs detailed comments regarding the purchase,
            identifies the applicable finding, and closes the case in IOD. The
            comments should provide information regarding the transaction and a
            detailed explanation of any findings. For administrative findings,
            the comments must state what documents or signatures were
            missing.</p>
        <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_11-4__Toc101163571">d. <strong class="ph b">Case Review Timeframe</strong>. Cases must be
            resolved within 30 calendar days of the billing cycle end date.</p>
        <p class="p">1) Billing officials must complete their review of assigned IOD cases
            within 15 calendar days of the billing cycle end date. Billing
            officials are recommended to review IOD cases when certifying their
            monthly statement. A/OPCs may suspend the managing account if IOD
            cases are not reviewed within 15 days.</p>
        <p class="p">2) Level 4 A/OPCs must close cases within 30 calendar days of the
            billing cycle end date. Level 3 A/OPCs may notify the Level 4
            A/OPC’s chain of command if cases are not closed within the required
            timeframe.</p>
        <p class="p">3) A/OPCs may add stricter controls regarding the timeline for
            completing IOD cases.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. At their discretion, A/OPCs may flag
            additional transactions for review within IOD. Billing officials are
            required to review these additional cases as part of the normal case
            review process and timeline.</p>
