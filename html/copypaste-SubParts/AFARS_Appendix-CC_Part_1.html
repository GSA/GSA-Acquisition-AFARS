      <span class="ph autonumber">CC-103</span> ACE Contracting Risk Management.</h2>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p">The ACE views internal control as a critical element for managing risk. The ACE manages risk to its strategic objectives and assesses the effectiveness of its internal controls, using Procurement Management Reviews, Peer Reviews, Independent Management Reviews, audits, training, self-assessments, and other management control activities. The use and periodic evaluation of key internal controls is an integral component of an organization’s management that provides reasonable assurance of the effectiveness and efficiency of the organization. Risk is defined as the effect of uncertainty on objectives. Risk management is a series of coordinated activities to direct and control challenges or threats to achieving an organization’s goals and objectives. Risk management on an enterprise-wide basis is an effective agency-wide approach to addressing the full spectrum of the organization’s external and internal risks by understanding the combined impact of risks across the organization, rather than addressing risks only within a single component of the organization. While agencies cannot respond to all risks related to achieving strategic objectives and performance goals, they must identify, measure, and assess risks related to mission execution. ACE risk management reflects forward-looking management decisions and balancing risks and returns so the ACE enhances its value to the taxpayer and increases its ability to achieve its strategic objectives.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">CC-104</span> ACE Contracting Risk Tolerance.</h2>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p">Risk tolerance is the acceptable level of variance in performance relative to the achievement of objectives. The ACE will tolerate a greater level of variance in performance in achieving reporting and compliance strategic objectives relative to the achievement of operations strategic objectives. However, variation in achievement of the non-operations strategic objectives is not tolerated when it negatively impacts the achievement of operations strategic objectives. This strategic guidance is intended to promote initiative and sound business judgment by the Acquisition Team in providing the best value product or service to meet the customer’s needs.</p>
