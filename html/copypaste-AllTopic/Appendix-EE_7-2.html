      <p class="p">2) <strong class="ph b">020206 Authoritative Guidance.</strong> Vendors and contractors offer
discounts, and banks issue various government purchase cards that provide
refunds to encourage early payment of their receivables. DoD will take advantage
of the discount and refund offers only when it is economically justified and
advantageous to the DoD. The DoD will follow the supporting guidelines for
taking discounts and refunds found in Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations
(CFR) 1315, FAR 32.906(e), and OMB Circular A 123, Appendix B, Chapter 7.</p>
