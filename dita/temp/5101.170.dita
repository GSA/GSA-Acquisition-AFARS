      </p>
      <p outputclass="List3">(i) <i>Army peer reviews.</i> With the exception of acquisitions using
         sealed bidding procedures (see FAR Part 14), a Solicitation Review Board (SRB) and a
         Contract Review Board (CRB) will approve all procurements with an estimated value of $50
         million or more including the award of task and delivery orders. A CRB is required for
         contract modifications that increase total evaluated price or otherwise increase scope. A
         CRB is not required for modifications that exercise an option, add incremental funding, or
         make administrative changes. The SRB and CRB will be independent, multi-functional teams
         comprised of senior level experts, which will, at a minimum, include representatives from
         the contracting activity, small business office, office of counsel, requirements community,
         and in the case of noncompetitive actions, the advocate for competition. The same members
         should participate in both the SRB and the CRB in order to ensure consistency.</p>
      <p outputclass="List3">(ii) <i>Objective of Army peer reviews.</i> The SRB/CRB will review and
         assess the presolicitation, solicitation and contract award documents for consistency,
         sufficiency, compliance and application of sound business practices. The SRB/CRB will
         verify that the procurement represents an overall good value to the Government and
         appropriate obligation of taxpayer funds.</p>
      <p outputclass="List3">(iii) <i>Resolution of comments.</i> The SCO will establish procedures
         for resolving all SRB and CRB comments.</p>
      <p outputclass="List3">(iv) <i>Peer review statistics. </i>Contracting activities will collect
         peer review statistics, to include annual data on the number of SRB/CRB reviews conducted
         and waived, identification of any systemic issues or trends, best practices, lessons
         learned, overall effectiveness of the process, and other data as determined necessary. </p>
