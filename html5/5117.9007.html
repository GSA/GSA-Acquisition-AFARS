In general, all orders exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold or involving non-pre-priced tasks exceeding $2,500 must be executed by a warranted contracting officer, but see 5117.9006(c)(2) for an exception.</p>
      <p class="p file:/home/ec2-user/ditatool/tce/AFARS/AFARS_Fixed/dita/5117.9007.ditap:3;9:30 List1">(c)  Only the contracting officer may exercise an option to extend, or issue any modification to, a job order contract (as opposed to an order under same).</p>

At least twice a year, the contracting officer must ensure that ordering officer files and procedures are reviewed and that a representative sampling of orders is selected for tracking from initiation of the requirement to final payment and close-out of the order.</p>
