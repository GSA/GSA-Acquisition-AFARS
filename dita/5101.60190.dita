      <p outputclass="List1">(a) General. Heads of the Contracting Activity (HCAs) have the authority to
            procure supplies and services to support all customer requirements, unless such
            procurements fall within the scope of unique contracting authorities assigned to another
            HCA as described in paragraph (b) below. This framework supports Category Management
            (CM) reforms, and promotes habitual customer relationships that leverage subject matter
            expertise to achieve greater contracting outcomes. The list of unique contracting
            authorities set forth in paragraph (b) is not all-inclusive and will continue to update
            as CM initiatives evolve. See <xref href="https://spcs3.kc.army.mil/asaalt/procurement/PGI/PGI_5101.aspx"
