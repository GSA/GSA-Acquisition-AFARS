      <p id="YKOEWK" outputclass="Normal" class="- topic/p ">a. Surcharges are fees that a retailer adds to the cost of a purchase when a customer uses a charge/credit card. As a result of the settlement between a class of retailers and the brands, on January 27, 2013, merchants in the United States and U.S. Territories are permitted to impose a surcharge on cardholders when a charge/credit card is used.</p>
      <p id="GqBtaY" outputclass="Normal" class="- topic/p ">b. Not all merchants impose a surcharge, and some states (California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Oklahoma and Texas) have laws which do not allow or limit surcharges. Cardholders who receive a surcharge or a check out fee in any of the above mentioned states should report the merchant to the state Attorney Generalâ€™s Office.</p>
      <p id="mIvrRY" outputclass="Normal" class="- topic/p ">c. Surcharges may not be added to debit, prepaid or cash purchases and cardholders are required to be notified in advance of making the purchase if a merchant will impose a surcharge. Merchants must also include the surcharge fee on any receipt(s) provided to the cardholder.</p>
      <p id="TcwPCl" outputclass="Normal" class="- topic/p ">d. Per Visa and MasterCard guidance, there is a limit to the allowable surcharge amounts. These limits vary by brand and by merchant discount rate. Information on surcharge limitations for Visa and MasterCard is available at:</p>

      <p id="uLFUlo" outputclass="Normal" class="- topic/p ">e. A/OPCs should ensure cardholders and other charge card management personnel are aware of the possibility of surcharges when making purchases using credit/charge cards. If a merchant is imposing a surcharge, the cardholder should consider choosing another merchant that offers the same or similar item(s) to avoid paying the surcharge.</p>
