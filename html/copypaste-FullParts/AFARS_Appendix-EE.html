      <span class="ph autonumber">1-1.</span> Overview</h3>
  <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. The Army Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFARS) Appendix EE provides policy guidance and procedures for the management of the Army Government Purchase Card (GPC) program. It implements and supplements sections of the Department of Defense (DoD) Government Charge Card Guidebook for Establishing and Managing Purchase, Travel, and Fuel Card Programs (hereinafter referred to as the DoD Charge Card Guidebook). If information is not discussed in this document or if this document is in conflict with the DoD GPC Policy, the DoD GPC Policy should be followed. This document applies to all purchases utilizing Army-issued GPCs. </p>
      <p class="p List1">b. Refer recommended changes and questions about the AFARS Appendix EE to the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army (Procurement) (ODASA(P)). Submit requests for waivers through the chain of command. Compliance with the AFARS Appendix EE is mandatory.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. The GPC program provides Army and supported organizations a simplified, streamlined method of purchasing and paying for supplies, services, construction projects, and contract payments. The program complies with Federal, DoD, and Army statutory and regulatory guidance, as well as the terms and conditions specified in the most current General Services Administration (GSA) SmartPay® 3 Master Contract. The primary benefit of the GPC Program is that the card-issuing banks provide a commercial purchase and payment service that replaces the paper-based, time-consuming purchase order process; reduces procurement lead time; provides transaction cost savings; reduces procurement office workload; provides refunds; and facilitates payment to include reductions in interest payments.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. The AFARS Appendix EE provides the procedures to use within the Army, including Army National Guard (ARNG) and Air National Guard (ANG), to establish and manage the Army GPC program. Army activities may supplement (i.e., adopt more stringent internal control requirements than the requirements cited herein), but not change this policy. However, as these are risk-managed programs, activities should maintain a proper balance between the control environment and ease of use to ensure that the benefits of the card continue to accrue. These procedures establish Army-wide standards designed to provide all Army activities with a foundation upon which to build specific standard operating procedures governing their programs.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-1__Toc532909289">e. Nonappropriated Fund (NAF) activities implement policies and procedures governing the Army’s Morale, Welfare, and Recreation programs and regulations for Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities (NAFI). Chaplaincy activities implement policies and procedures governing Army Chaplain Corps activities. Army NAFIs/entities must operate within the parameters of these procedures to include Public Health Command (PHC) NAFIs, Department of Defense Education Activities (DoDEA) NAFIs, and Army National Guard NAFIs. NAF activities will comply with the Department of Defense Policies and Procedures Governing Non-Appropriated Funds SmartPay® 3 Government-wide Commercial Purchase Card Use – SP3 Transition Memorandum #11.</p>

        <p class="p">The purchase card can be used in three ways, depending on the value
            of the transaction and the authority of the cardholder (CH). See
            Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.301. Table 1-1 summarizes
            the three methods and provides descriptions and examples. </p>

            purchase fixed-price commercial supplies and services that do not
            require the CH to agree to any terms and conditions other than price
            and delivery. These purchases are limited to the applicable
            micro-purchase threshold (MPT).</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Micro-purchases (Convenience Check).</strong> Convenience checks may
            be used and set up under a separate billing official (BO) account to
            buy commercially available, fixed-price supplies and services to
            fulfill mission-essential requirements. All check purchases must be
            within the applicable convenience check MPT. A separate account must
            be issued for each convenience check account.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Orders Against Pre-Existing Contract Vehicles.</strong> The GPC may
            be used to place task or delivery orders against pre-priced contract
            vehicles and agreements if authorized in the basic contract, basic
            ordering agreement, or blanket purchase agreement. (Appropriated
            fund CHs cannot purchase against nonappropriated fund
            contracts).</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Contract Payments.</strong> The GPC may be used to make contract
            payments against fully funded contracts found to be advantageous to
            the Government when compared to other methods of payment, and the
            contractor accepts payment by the GPC. The contract should include
            the third-party payment clause identified in FAR 32.1108, Payment by
            Governmentwide Commercial Purchase Card; however, GPC contract
            payments may be made if the contractor agrees to accept the GPC as a
            method of payment.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">1-3.</span> Information and Waiver Process</h3>
  <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. Cardholders should direct GPC-related questions to their billing
      official. If the BO cannot resolve the issue, they should direct the issue
      to their Agency/Organization Program Coordinator (A/OPC) (Level 4 A/OPC).
      If the A/OPC cannot resolve an issue, the A/OPC should direct the question
      to the Oversight Agency/Organization Program Coordinator (OA/OPC) (Level 3
      A/OPC). If the OA/OPC cannot resolve the issue, the OA/OPC should consult
      the Component Program Manager (CPM) (Level 2 A/OPC) for guidance.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. All waivers, exceptions, and deviations to the guidance provided in
      AFARS Appendix EE must be in writing and routed to the ODASA(P) CPM for
      approval. Requests to waive, take exception to, or deviate from the rules,
      regulations, processes or procedures will be reviewed on a case-by-case
      basis. Requests for waivers should be submitted through the GPC chain of
      command. The CPM will retain copies of all approved waiver packages. In
      times of emergencies, a waiver approval may be obtained either through
      email or telephone call from the CPM with a follow up waiver request
      letter from the requesting command/activity. The letter must detail the
      reasons for the request and what adverse mission impact would occur if the
      waiver was not granted.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">1-5.</span> GPC Authority</h3>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. GPC programs require procurement authority to operate and cannot be
established or maintained unless procurement authority is granted in accordance
with governing laws and regulations and delegated through a contracting activity
identified in Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS)
Procedures, Guidance, and Information (PGI) 202.101 and the DoD Charge Card
Guidebook. Contracting authority flows from authorities granted in Titles 10 and
41, United States Code (10 and 41 USC) from DoD to the Secretary of the Army to
the Heads of Contracting Activities (HCAs). The HCA re-delegates contracting
authority to local procurement offices. The Senior Contracting Official (SCO) or
Chief of Contracting Office (CCO) may re-delegate their GPC procurement
authority listed in Table 1-3 to OA/OPCs or A/OPCs for OA/OPCs and A/OPCs to
appoint cardholders and convenience check account holders through the Delegation
of Contracting Authority Letter produced in the Joint Appointment Module (JAM)
within the <a class="xref" href="https://piee.eb.mil/xhtml/unauth/home/login.xhtml" target="_blank">Procurement Integrated Enterprise Environment (PIEE)</a>.
See sections 1-8 and 5-1 for more information. Cardholders must countersign to
acknowledge this responsibility.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. The Joint Appointment Module (JAM), an application within PIEE, is the
mandatory enterprise tool for appointing and delegating authority to GPC
personnel.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. Orientation and training are prerequisites to receiving GPC delegated
authority via an appointment in JAM. Training requirements are listed in Chapter
4.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. Generally, only a Government employee can be a cardholder or billing
official. National Guard traditional members and State employees should not be
CHs or BOs. The following exceptions apply:</p>
      <p class="p">1) Foreign nationals may be appointed as CHs only if they are direct hires
working for the U.S. Government. However, commanders/directors should consider
the potential consequences of appointing foreign nationals as CHs in countries
where Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs) or local laws do not subject the
foreign national employee to the same pecuniary or general financial liability
or disciplinary actions for charge card violation as U.S. citizens.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC) instructors are members of
the Armed Forces in accordance with USACC Regulation 145-2, section 4-2, and may
be designated micro-purchase procurement authority as GPC cardholders. See FAR
1.603-3(b).</p>

  <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p">These procedures apply to all GPC purchases with cards and convenience checks issued by the Army.</p>
      <p class="p List1">a. Non-Army tenant organizations issued Army GPCs or convenience checks by an Army contracting office are also subject to these procedures. All BOs, CHs, A/OPCs, Resource Managers (RMs), Logisticians, and other stakeholders participating in the Army GPC program are subject to these procedures, including any non-Army tenant organizations where the Army has contracting authority and oversight responsibilities (such as ANG units).</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. The ODASA(P) has overall responsibility for the Army GPC program. Each Army command, organization, or activity utilizing Army GPCs has the responsibility for the following actions:</p>
      <p class="p">1) Provide adequate resources and effective internal controls to ensure the appropriate management, operation, training, and oversight is in place to operate a local GPC program effectively and efficiently in compliance with Army policies and procedures.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Establish and maintain a command climate to prevent Army personnel or others from exercising undue influence over the actions of an A/OPC, BO or CH.</p>
      <p class="p">3) Take appropriate informal and formal disciplinary actions in the event of noncompliance, fraud, misuse and/or abuse. Disciplinary actions should be based on the severity and frequency of the infraction and can range from informal actions such as written or verbal counseling, to demotion, removal, loss of security clearance, or potential criminal prosecution.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">2-9.</span> Management of the GPC Program</h3>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. The OUSD DPC Level 1 A/OPC interprets and tailors federal statutory and
regulatory laws and guidance for DoD usage, develops business rules common to
all DoD corporate card programs (purchase, travel, air, fleet, and fuel), and
codifies them in the DoD Charge Card Guidebook.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. The ODASA(P) has overall responsibility for the management of the Army GPC
program. The ODASA(P) appoints a CPM, also known as the Level 2 A/OPC, to manage
the Army GPC program. The SCO, or in activities that do not have a SCO, the CCO
or equivalent, designates, at a minimum, one Level 3 OA/OPC and an alternate
Level 3 OA/OPC who, once appointed in JAM, is dedicated to the management of the
GPC Program within their agency/organization. The SCO or CCO may further
delegate in writing the authority to appoint the Level 3 and 4 A/OPCs in
accordance with Army policy. Level 3 A/OPCs with authority to delegate
procurement authority must have the corresponding appointment letter in JAM to
appoint Level 4 A/OPCs. Level 4 A/OPCs may appoint CHs and billing officials in
JAM if they are given the authority to delegate procurement authority and have
the corresponding appointment letter in JAM. Certifying officers must be
appointed by the organization’s designated DD 577 appointing authority in
JAM.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. The Level 3 OA/OPC duties and responsibilities at Army major command
headquarters typically warrant a grade (or equivalent thereof) of GS-14,
preferably in the contracting career field, but exceptions may apply if approved
by the SCO or CCO. The Level 3 A/OPC duties and responsibilities for
non-headquarter commands typically warrant a grade of GS-12 to GS-14, preferably
in the contracting career field, but exceptions may apply if approved by the SCO
or CCO.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. The Level 4 A/OPC duties and responsibilities typically warrant a grade
(or equivalent thereof) of GS-11 to GS-12 in any career field (e.g., 1101, 1105,
or 343) as long as they meet the knowledge, skills, and abilities listed below.
The A/OPC will be designated by the appropriate contracting official to be
responsible for the management, administration, and day-to-day operation of the
GPC program at the activity. Written delegations are required in JAM, and each
A/OPC will be granted the appropriate system access (e.g., JAM, bank EAS)
associated with their role. Level 3 and 4 A/OPCs must complete the training
requirements detailed in Chapter 4. Only individuals who possess the following
knowledge, skills, and abilities may be appointed as Level 3 and 4 A/OPCs for
the GPC Program:</p>
      <p class="p">1) Understanding of the relevant GPC policies, procedures, and commercial
contracting practices.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Understanding of the relevant procurement laws and regulations.</p>
      <p class="p">3) Understanding of what constitutes an authorized purchase transaction.</p>
      <p class="p">4) Understanding of procurement methods and standards.</p>
      <p class="p">5) Ability to communicate, organize, and manage tasks effectively.</p>
      <p class="p">6) Basic analytical and computer skills.</p>
      <p class="p">7) Ability to summarize data, prepare reports and write effectively using
proper grammar, punctuation, and tone.</p>
      <p class="p">8) Ability to analyze, research, and provide concise recommendations to the
chain of command on required actions to anticipate, prevent, or correct problems
in business processes that are supported by the GPC.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. The Government Charge Card Abuse and Prevention Act of 2012 requires all
Executive Branch agencies to establish and maintain safeguards and internal
controls to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse of purchase cards. Internal controls
are tools to help program and financial managers achieve results and safeguard
the integrity of their programs. Effective internal controls provide reasonable
assurance that significant risks or weaknesses adversely impacting the agency's
ability to meet its objectives are prevented, minimized, or are detected in a
timely manner. The Level 3 and Level 4 A/OPC will notify the BO or CH of any
action taken due to a BO’s or CH’s non-compliance with Army policies and
procedures.</p>
      <p class="p List1">f. Level 3 and Level 4 A/OPCs have the authority to apply internal controls
such as suspending or cancelling BO or CH accounts; lowering credit limits;
adding or deleting Merchant Category Codes (MCC); and initiating additional
controls as necessary to comply with GPC policies and procedures.</p>
      <p class="p List1">g. Results of legal reviews are not sufficient justification for CHs to
proceed with a particular purchase. If a CH or BO is unsure if they can proceed
with a questionable purchase, they should contact the Level 4 A/OPC for guidance
and confirm authority prior to making the purchase.</p>
      <p class="p List1">h. Army agencies and organizations must provide adequate resources dedicated
to the GPC program within their agency/organization to ensure successful
management of the program. Adequate GPC resources refer to an agency’s efficient
and effective deployment of assets (e.g., span of control, personnel, training,
funding, facilities, and deployment of knowledge and skills) as needed to comply
with the policies, procedures, laws, and regulations governing the GPC Program.
Adequate resources must be deployed to reasonably ensure that programs achieve
their intended results; resources are used consistently with agency mission;
programs and resources are protected from fraud, waste, and mismanagement; laws
and regulations are followed; and reliable and timely information is obtained,
maintained, and reported for decision-making.</p>
      <p class="p List1">i. The local contracting offices must coordinate with the local personnel
office to ensure procedures are established requiring all individuals to
coordinate with the Level 4 A/OPC when they out-process from the

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. OMB standards for internal controls require that key duties and
responsibilities be divided or segregated among individuals to ensure they do
not exceed or abuse their assigned authority. See OMB Circular A-123, Appendix B
Revised, paragraph 4.3. Separation of duties is an internal control activity
intended to provide checks and balances to the GPC process and to prevent or
minimize innocent errors or intentional fraud occurring without detection. This
internal control ensures that no single individual has control over multiple
phases of a purchase card transaction. To protect the integrity of the
procurement process, no one person is responsible for an entire purchase card
transaction. Key purchase card functions must be handled by different
individuals. Inadequate separation of duties could allow errors and fraud to
occur without detection. Key duties, such as making purchases (CH), authorizing
payments (BO), certifying funding (RM), and reviewing transactions (Level 4
A/OPCs and APOs) must be assigned to different individuals to minimize the risk
of loss to the Government to the greatest extent possible.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. If resource constraints prevent assignment of the key duties to different
individuals, as set forth in paragraph a. above, the activity must request a
waiver through the Level 4 A/OPC and the CCO to the Level 3 A/OPC for
approval.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. Notwithstanding the above-described waiver process, certain key duties
must not be assigned to the same individual. In no case will the same individual
be the CH and the BO for a GPC account. In no case will the Accountable Property
Officer or any A/OPC (primary or alternate) also be a CH, BO or contracting
officer who is making contract payments with a GPC or executing GPC purchases. A
CH who is a hand receipt holder should not purchase property for their own use.
The servicing bank provides the functionality to generate a report identifying
potential conflicts of interest in GPC program duties.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">2-11.</span> Span of Control</h3>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. Span of control refers to the extent of oversight and review
responsibilities placed on a single A/OPC, BO, or CH. An appropriate span of
control must efficiently and effectively allow the A/OPC, BO, or CH to provide
reasonable assurance they can effectively perform their responsibilities
regardless of the number of accounts assigned. The assigned span of control must
factor in the monitoring and oversight responsibilities to include the use of
MasterCard’s Insights on Demand (IOD) data mining and review process.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. The Army standard for span of control for a Level 4 A/OPC will not be more
than 250 total accounts to one Level 4 A/OPC. This number includes both BO and
CH accounts. Span of control updates are deemed necessary due to changing
program dynamics and increased oversight burdens placed on GPC oversight
personnel over time. As the micro-purchase threshold has increased multiple
times over the years, additional oversight has been required as the average
dollar value and the types and complexity of the GPC supplies and services being
purchased has increased. A/OPCs and other GPC oversight officials have also been
required to fulfill additional duties related to statutory and regulatory DoD
Charge Card Guidebook, FAR, and DFARS requirements, including complying with
Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 NDAA Section 889(a)(1) requirements. These dynamics
warranted a reduction in the number of GPC accounts an A/OPC is authorized to
oversee, and the flexibility for Component Program Managers to deviate from
updated span of control ratios when sufficient compensating controls are in
place.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. A ratio of not more than seven card accounts to a primary BO is the Army
standard. Ensuring a reasonable number of card accounts are assigned to each
primary BO is paramount to the effective accomplishment of the BO’s
responsibilities. The total number of transactions, as well as the number of
assigned card accounts, must be considered when determining an acceptable card
account to BO ratio.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. When the number of accounts (250:1 account per A/OPC) or workload
complexity/administration assigned to a Level 4 A/OPC exceeds the Army standard,
the SCO and the CCO must ensure adequate resources are made available to allow
the A/OPCs to successfully perform their duties. When the span of control
exceeds the Army standard and the CCO elects not to provide additional
resources, the CCO must submit a waiver request in writing to the CPM for
approval. The waiver request must include the rationale and justification upon
which the CCO has based the determination that the existing span of control is
adequate to ensure program administration and that surveillance can be performed
at a satisfactory level given the existing or new compensatory controls put in
place. The Level 3 A/OPC must retain a copy of this documentation.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. The Level 4 A/OPC determines whether the BO to CH ratio is acceptable upon
issuance of a GPC, during the A/OPC’s annual assessment of their GPC program, or
as needed. There must be a reasonable expectation that the BO can complete a
thorough review of all transactions and certify the invoice within five business
days of its receipt. When the ratio for CH accounts to BO exceeds the Army
standard, the BO should lower the number of card accounts or request a waiver to
policy. The Level 4 A/OPC will document all cases where the CH to BO ratio
exceeds the Army standard. The waiver to policy request must address the unique
conditions that affect the process and show, with a high degree of certainty,
that the BO can be expected to comply with the review and certification
procedures. The request must include the number and location of assigned CHs,
the total average number of transactions made by the CHs, the amount of time the
BO can devote to the certification process, the history of delinquencies, and
other appropriate factors. The waiver is approved at the following levels
indicated below and maintained by the approver with copies furnished to the
BO:</p>
      <p class="p">1) 8–10 card accounts. Routed through the Level 4 A/OPC to the CCO.</p>
      <p class="p">2) 11–19 card accounts. Routed through the A/OPCs (Level 4 and Level 3) to
the SCO.</p>
      <p class="p">3) 20 or more card accounts. Routed through the A/OPCs (Level 4 and Level 3)
to the Level 2.</p>

capability that uses a Common Access Card (CAC) enabled single-sign-on
capability to grant access to system modules (e.g., Electronic Document Access
and Joint Appointment Module (JAM)) hosted both internal and external to that
environment. Army mandates 100% use of PIEE single-sign-on. PIEE reduces DoD
operating costs by facilitating rapid development and deployment of modules and
providing common services such as testing, archive retention, and security. It
also improves the quality of and access to enterprise-wide data by leveraging
cloud technology and drawing data from multiple modules into a single data set
for use across the platform.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. PIEE controls access and enables automation through every phase of the
procurement process in addition to reducing manual data entry and administrative
tasks (e.g., role nominations, workflows, data pre-population, error tracking,
document management, and training certificates). PIEE’s messaging capabilities
provide a centralized way to securely communicate and share important
information across organizations and roles. Global access to information such as
reports, documents, and workflow statuses allow all users to have greater
visibility into the procurement process at any time.</p>

    <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. WAWF is an application in the PIEE eBusiness Suite used by
            contractors to invoice and by Government officials to accept and
            certify for goods and services. Contractors must submit contract
            invoices electronically, mandated by Public Law: Section 1008 of the
            NDAA of FY 2001. DFARS Clause 252.232-7003 (DFARS 232.7004) requires
            electronic invoicing and electronic supporting documentation. WAWF
            allows vendors to submit and track invoices and allows the Army to
            receive and accept those invoices over the Web, enabling the Army to
            process those invoices in a real-time, paperless environment.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">GPC Use of WAWF.</strong> When the GPC is used as the method of
            payment on a contract, the contractor must create a receiving report
            in WAWF. The Government acceptor must then accept the receiving
            report in WAWF.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. WAWF users must register in <a class="xref" href="https://piee.eb.mil/xhtml/unauth/help/help.xhtml" target="_blank">PIEE</a> and request the corresponding role. The
            contractor will request the “Vendor” role, and the Government
            acceptor will request the “Acceptor” role. Refer to the
            "Registration" link on the PIEE home page and the Help button for
            details on registering in WAWF. For more information, contact <a class="xref" href="http://www.dfas.mil/" target="_blank">DFAS Customer Service</a>: 1-800-756-4571.

The CH reconciles the statement of account throughout the month by reviewing it for accuracy and comparing it with his or her purchase log entries. If the statement is correct, the CH approves it within three business days from the end of the billing cycle. If the statement is incorrect, the CH must contact the merchant and request correction. If the merchant does not cooperate or provide the ordered goods and services, the CH disputes the incorrect transaction.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-11__dEFVdG">b. The BO must ensure GPC transactions are legal, proper, and correct in accordance with Government rules and regulations. If the billing statement is correct following the BO’s review throughout the month, certification of the billing statement is done within five business days from the end of the billing cycle. If the BO finds questionable transactions, the CH must be contacted to review supporting documentation. If the BO determines the CH is negligent, the BO takes appropriate action in accordance with DOD and Army policy, and informs the Level 4 A/OPC of the action taken. Disputes must be filed by one of three methods: calling the Servicing Bank, faxing over a Cardholder Statement of Questioned Items form or using the Servicing Bank’s dispute process in AXOL, within 60 days of the cycle end date in which the transaction appeared in order to retain the Government’s dispute rights.</p>

The date received, along with the signature (or electronic alternative when supported by appropriate internal controls), printed name, telephone number, and office designator or address of the receiving official will be recorded on the sales invoice, packing slip, bill of lading, or other shipping or receiving document as confirmation of receipt. The billing official verifies the existence of receipt and acceptance documentation during reconciliation of the billing statement.</p>

See DOD FMR Volume 15, Chapter 6 for additional information on document retention for accountable officers’ records (10 years from the date of case closure for Foreign Military Sales).</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-13__GZAkjP">b. All financial records, both paper and electronic, must be retained documenting the GPC transactions in a file to include (1) the BO statement, (2) the CH statement, and (3) all original receipts and documentation for those statements.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-13__p_OLE_LINK10">c. Receipts are considered supporting documents for the certified billing statement and in accordance with the DOD FMR, Volume 1, Chapter 9, must be retained for six years and three months after final payment. Original receipts are preferred; however, printed electronic forms or copies of an itemized receipt are acceptable. The receipt must be legible; goods must be itemized/detailed with the item description, quantity, price, and extended price; indicate vendor’s name and address; date of the purchase; and must indicate paid by credit card or zero amount due. The BO maintains these records, either physically in his/her physical possession, or when appropriate transfers to a records holding area. However, if certifying electronically, the CH and BO may rely on the Servicing Bank recordkeeping for the BO and CH statements. Original records are the property of the U.S. Government and may not be removed from government control by the BO for any reason.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">3-14.</span>  Convenience Checks and Foreign Draft Checks</h3>
  <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__xshUjw">a. Convenience checks and Foreign Draft Checks (FDCs) provide activities with the flexibility to issue checks for payment of supplies and services. With the exception of contingencies, convenience checks shall not be written over the micro-purchase threshold. Convenience checks are issued for domestic purchases valued in U.S. dollars when the merchant does not accept the GPC. DOD activities have the flexibility to issue convenience checks to pay for products and services at the activity level. FDCs are issued for overseas purchases valued in foreign currency when the merchant does not accept the GPC. The following requirements apply to one or both of these financial instruments as specified.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__bSwhIR">b. The CH shall not use a convenience check or FDC unless its use is considered advantageous to the activity after evaluating all alternative methods of purchase. Convenience checks and FDCs may not be used to avoid the normal GPC payment process. Before a check is issued, the paying agency must make every effort to use the GPC, including making maximum efforts to find and use merchants that accept the GPC. The authority to maintain a checkbook shall be justified on an individual organization basis and controlled and monitored by the organization’s CCO. The number of checkbooks per installation must be kept to a minimum. A delegation of procurement authority is granted in writing by the CCO for the maintenance and use of convenience checks.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__ZrACMc">c. Convenience checkbook accounts are available only to organizations that maintain active GPC accounts in good standing. A convenience checkbook holder may have a GPC account and a separate convenience checkbook account. Convenience checks are pre-numbered, and their use is controlled with a separate convenience check purchase log for each account. Checkbook holder shall maintain original voided checks.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__iCsIMh">d. Convenience checks and FDCs are not issued for more than the micro-purchase threshold (or the foreign currency equivalent), and must be issued for the exact payment amount. In the case of an FDC, the payment amount includes the administrative processing fee. However, in the case of convenience checks, the payment amount does not include the administrative processing fee. The convenience check processing fee is added by the servicing bank during processing of the transaction, and the addition of the processing fee is not considered a split requirement. “Splitting” payment amounts across more than one convenience check or FDC to keep the purchase amount per check below the micro-purchase threshold limit is prohibited. Convenience checks and FDCs will not be issued as an “exchange-for-cash” vehicle to establish cash funds. If merchants issue credit or refunds by cash or check, the funds must be immediately credited to the account against which the purchase
      was originally made.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__rfjIEp">e. Convenience checks and FDCs are negotiable instruments and must be stored in a locked container, such as a safe or locking filing cabinet. Checks must be accounted for appropriately to prevent loss, theft, or potential forgery. Convenience check and FDC accounts must be reviewed quarterly by a disinterested party and not the A/OPC. The checks are reconciled just as other GPC transactions, as a part of the monthly statement billing cycle. Copies of voided checks must be retained through the carbon copy or photocopy the original check as a part of the account-holder's original documentation files.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__EHLYVf">f. The same purchase prohibitions that apply to the GPC apply to the convenience check and the FDC.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__FrZbzw">g. The normal dispute process associated with the GPC is not applicable to convenience checks and FDCs. Any concerns over a purchase made with a check must be resolved directly with the merchant. The check writer is solely responsible for securing credit or disputing purchases with the merchant. Each organization is responsible for all checks written on an account; unless it is determined fraud is involved (see Section 4-5 on fraud). In some cases, payment can be stopped on a convenience check that has been written if the check has not yet been posted to an account. To stop payment on a check, the check-writer must call the Servicing Bank’s Customer Service Department to receive instructions on processing the action.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__fprbou">h. FDC accounts are established in the contracting office. Customer activities desiring FDC accounts outside the contracting office must justify, in writing, to the CCO why an account is necessary. FDC BOs, cashiers, and custodians must receive standard GPC training prior to being issued active FDC accounts.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__EMCumm">i. The check cashier is the only person who has the authority to issue and sign checks. He or she may hold a GPC account in addition to the convenience check FDC account, as long as the accounts are maintained separately.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__LmKCJu">j. The check custodian orders, receives, stores, issues, inventories, reconciles, and disposes of FDC stock. He or she is not responsible for approving and processing requirements for check writing.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__HFjUZN">k. The BO authorizes and certifies the issuance of FDCs written by the cashier. In order to maintain effective internal controls, the BO may not perform the check-writing and maintenance functions of the cashier and custodian. All convenience checks and FDCs must be reconciled as a part of the monthly billing statement at the end of the billing cycle.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__SrjGai">l. Establishing Convenience Check Accounts. Any U.S. Government employee, military or civilian, including local national employees, may be selected for appointment as a check writer. Contractors working for the Army must not to be selected for appointment. Requests to establish convenience check accounts must be justified in writing by the organization’s Commander/Director and forwarded to the Level 4 A/OPC. If approved, a delegation of procurement authority is granted in writing by the CCO, for the maintenanceand use of convenience checks. Required information must consist of the following:</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__geiYIf">(1) Reason for requesting checks</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__ijKbEJ">(2) Types of vendors the check will be written to</p>

      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__fLkdsu">m. Use of Convenience Check Accounts.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__OPDtja">(1) Convenience checks may be used for small purchases, when supplies or service are available for delivery within 15 days whether at the contractor’s place of business or at destination. Convenience checks must not be used for employee reimbursements, cash advances, cash awards, travel-related transportation payments, or meals. Purchases made with the check must not require detailed specifications or an inspection report. Convenience checks should not be used for recurring payments.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__niSMFw">(2) Convenience checks may be used for purposes not related to small purchases when such expenditures are authorized by other regulations such as:</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__lQDmjz">(a) Delivery charges associated with the purchases made with a convenience check when the contractor is requesting to arrange delivery. These charges include local delivery, parcel post including cash on delivery (COD) postal charges, and line haul or inter-city transportation charges, provided the charges are determined in the best interest of the Government.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__gPepIS">(b) C.O.D. charges for supplies ordered for payment with a convenience check upon delivery.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__PiOUnd">n.Tax Reporting - The 1099 Tax Reporting Process (TRP) was developed to collect convenience checks written for services, rent, medical and health care services and other Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requirements. This data is used to process IRS 1099-MISC forms. The BO is responsible to monitor the check writer's compliance with 1099-TRP.</p>
      <p class="p" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__NAUNvc">(1) Convenience check holders must submit check data to DFAS on any checks they issue for tax reportable categories. This should be done throughout the year and is suggested to be completed monthly, and can be done on-line once the check writer and their corresponding A/OPC officially request access to the 1099 TRP. The 1099 TRP is restricted to authorized users only. Access is optional for the BO, but may be necessary to fulfill the BO's responsibility to ensure the check writer is compliant with 1099 TRP.</p>
      <p class="p" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__bbkrxa">(2) 1099 TRP System Access: To obtain access, users must complete two system access forms, DD form 2875 and DD form 2869.

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-15__celqVc">The Army must satisfy requirements for supplies and services from or through the sources and publications listed in the descending order of priority in FAR Part 8.002. The Office Supply BPAs fall under mandatory Federal supply schedules and must be utilized for office supply purchases unless an exception applies. The Office Supply BPAs can be accessed through the Army Corridor of the DOD EMALL site: <a class="xref" href="https://dod-emall.dla.mil/acct/" target="_blank"> 
            <u class="ph u">https://dod-emall.dla.mil/acct/</u> 
         </a>. The primary goals of the Office Supply BPAs are to ensure that office product purchases are in compliance with the statutory preferences afforded to products manufactured under the AbilityOne Program, capture economies of scale, and realize significant savings while providing opportunities for small business. Exceptions to the mandatory use of the BPAs and DOD EMALL are as follows:</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-15__IRQfTO">(1) This policy does not apply to purchases made Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS).</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-15__BGIlgn">(2) Purchases made directly from AbilityOne or from AbilityOne Base Supply Centers (BSCs). Cardholders may purchase office and cleaning supplies directly from AbilityOne Base Supply Centers and are exempt from using the Office Supply BPAs. These products are available at Base Supply Centers on military installations or in federal buildings.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-15__FXqWNE">(3) Cardholders may purchase National Stock Number (NSN) items directly from AbilityOne BSCs and are exempt from using the Standard Army Retail Supply System (SARSS) or the Office Supply BPAs. When NSN products are not available from the BSCs, then cardholders should use the SARSS to purchase NSN Products.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-15__PqbZKX">(4) Purchases made from wholesale supply sources such as stock programs of the General Services Administration (e.g. GSA Global Supply Center).</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-15__jYfRbG">(5) Cardholders may purchase an item from another source if an urgent need exists for an unplanned requirement needed for the same day. Poor acquisition planning and inadequate market research would not apply to this exception. Use of this exception requires valid documentation and retention in the purchase card file.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-15__KLoIWt">(6) NAFI cardholders must comply with the required sources (see paragraph 3-5). When purchasing office supplies, NAFI GPC cardholders shall consider the AbilityOne Base Supply Centers or the Office Supply BPAs on the DOD EMALL Army Corridor as a practical choice. If it is not in the best interest of the NAFI to purchase through AbilityOne Base Supply Centers or the Office Supply BPAs, the cardholder may consider other required sources. The cardholder must adequately document the decision to not purchase from the AbilityOne Base Supply Centers or the Office Supply BPAs before an open-market source can be considered.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-15__etRgli">(7) In the event the DoD EMALL is unavailable for more than 24 hours, cardholders may place orders with the Office Supply BPA vendor through another form of communication.</p>

      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-16__hSgyck">a. Rebates are posted as credits against billing statements and applied at the billing statement level unless specified otherwise by the Level 2 A/OPC. Rebates are automatically assigned to the default line of accounting (LOA) on the billing statement. BOs should reallocate the rebates across various LOAs (of the same appropriation) to the extent that no single LOA has a credit balance. Under no circumstance will the CH retain gift checks, vendor rebates or other purchase incentives that can be converted to personal use. If received, these items must be turned over to the U.S. Treasury.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-16__zyMrfm">b. Unless specific authority exists allowing rebates to be used for other purposes, rebates must be returned to the appropriation or account from which they were expended, and can be used for any legitimate purchase by the appropriation or account to which they were returned, or as otherwise authorized by statute.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-16__MiokhY">c. Credit transactions are posted as credits against billing statements, applied at the billing statement level. When a closed account carries a credit balance the amount shall be sent via check to the Level 4 A/OPC. The check will be addressed to US Government or US Treasury. The Level 4 A/OPC shall work with his/her RM in identifying an account and in determining how the credit is distributed within the installation.</p>

Reimbursements such as rebates, merchant credits, or other credits attributable to accounts closed during the quarter or accounts not having enough purchases to offset the credit, require the Servicing Bank to issue quarterly checks to the Level 4 A/OPC. Merchant credits must be applied back to the funding appropriation. Rebates must be used in the fiscal year they are received.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-16__hTjmgr">e. Each Level 4 A/OPC is directed to deliver all reimbursement check(s) to their RM within five (5) days of receipt, retain a copy of each reimbursement check(s), and obtain the RM's signature acknowledging their receipt and acceptance of the reimbursement check(s). The CH, BO, and RM should have a process to ensure adequate controls are in place to track credits and rebates. Questions related to reimbursements in the form of a rebate, merchant credit, or other credit should be directed to your local RM. CHs must forward their monthly cardholder statement to the BO with the appropriate supporting documentation, within 5 working days, to maximize rebates and minimize prompt payment penalties.</p>

    <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">Mandatory training is divided into initial online training and formal
            training. Prior to assuming their duties, program personnel will
            complete the GPC training appropriate to their position. The
            training requirements for CHs and BOs trained at a previous duty
            station may be abbreviated or waived, in writing, as determined by
            the A/OPC. A/OPCs will retain copies of initial and refresher
            training certificates by uploading the certificates in PIEE.</p>
        <p class="p List1">a. Level 4 A/OPCs, in coordination with the appropriate subject
            matter experts, will provide in-person initial GPC training for all
            new BOs and CHs prior to using the GPC. Each Level 4 A/OPC is
            responsible for providing training to CHs and BOs utilizing the Army
            Master Training slides and GPC program location-specific slides.
            Training methods can be classroom, virtual or electronic.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. Resource Managers should assist the A/OPC in developing or
            providing training on funding document maintenance, Anti-Deficiency
            Act, and the certification and payment process.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. Small Business Specialists should assist the A/OPC in developing
            or providing training on FAR 19, Small Business procedures and
            achieving small business goals.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. Hazardous Materials Management Process Team should assist the
            A/OPC in developing or providing training on the procurement,
            maintenance, and disposal of hazardous materials.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. GPC training requirements are listed in Tables 4-1 and 4-2. Table
            4-1 lists all mandatory training which must be completed prior to
            issuance of an appointment letter and/or establishment of a GPC
            account. Table 4-2 lists all recommended training as necessary to
            carry out GPC duties. Proof of training must be documented and
            retained by the A/OPC in PIEE/JAM. CHs, BOs, and A/OPCs are required
            to complete mandated initial and refresher training. U.S. Bank’s
            Access Online web-based training is optional. The initial in person
            GPC training provided by the Level 4 A/OPC will cover training on
            the use of U.S. Bank’s Access Online system (e.g., initiating and
            resolving disputes, reconciling and approving statements, certifying
            invoices, and uploading supporting documentation).</p>
        <p class="p List1">f. <strong class="ph b">Refresher Training</strong>. As required in DoD FMR Volume 5,
            Chapter 5, Paragraph 050304, appointed Certifying Officers must
            complete an approved Certifying Officer Legislation training course
            before their appointment and refresher training annually. All
            A/OPCs, BOs, and CHs must complete refresher training every two
            years. The local command may require refresher training more
            frequently to satisfy their training or operational needs. <a class="xref" href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/asda/dpc/ce/pc/training.html" target="_blank">DPC GPC One-Pagers</a> are “quick start guides”
            that address various GPC policies and systems. Several One-Pagers
            have been developed to address items related to SmartPay® 3 systems.
            See the <a class="xref" href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/asda/dpc/ce/pc/training.html" target="_blank">GPC Training page</a> for links.</p>
        <p class="p List1">g. By signing the appointment letter in JAM, CHs and BOs confirm that
            they have received the initial GPC program training and understand
            their roles and responsibilities and the penalties associated with
            misuse of the card.</p>
        <p class="p List1">h. All initial and refresher training certificates will be uploaded
            into PIEE/JAM. Attendance at the annual GSA SmartPay Conference is
            mandatory for all Level 3 and 4 A/OPCs, as funding permits.
            Attendance is mandatory for all Level 3 and 4 A/OPCs if the GSA
            SmartPay Conference is held virtually.</p>

Due to enhancement of program oversight, the Purchase Card On-Line System (PCOLS) is mandated for GPC participants Army-wide and accessible at: <a class="xref" href="https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/appj/pcols-web/" target="_blank">

      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-4__gCtZvD">b. <u class="ph u">EMMA</u> is used to capture and define organizational purchase card hierarchies, document authority chains, and identify relationships among purchase card roles. EMMA increases the accuracy of personnel data and institute more robust inclusion of supervisors (e.g., cardholder and managing account supervisors). EMMA acts to electronically define the GPC hierarchy, the roles within the hierarchy, and assigns individuals to those roles. Additionally, EMMA enables the A/OPC to alter or remove any personnel from assigned roles reflecting changes to hierarchy structures, also known as provisioning.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-4__GphuTV">c. <u class="ph u">AIM</u> is used to initiate, approve, and transmit requests for GPC issuance and maintenance actions. AIM draws from hierarchies (e.g., role responsibilities and permissions) established in EMMA. It directly engages GPC supervisors, helps ensure business rules comply with internal organizational management controls, and is a workflow tool performing various GPC Program account authorization and maintenance functions.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-4__psItaF">d. <u class="ph u">Data Mining (DM)</u> programmatically reviews 100% of the DoD purchase card transactions using sophisticated intelligent/learning software and identifies correlations, patterns, and trends in purchase card buying actions. This transaction review allows daily, near-real-time mining of the data. The Case Manager, which is an integral component of DM, interprets the referred transactions and creates specific cases that are assigned to the Approving/Billing Officials (A/BOs) for review. Through the use of the Case Manager Interview Process, the A/BO demonstrates that due diligence is exercised in the review of the referred transactions. With this DM tool, scarce human resources can be targeted on identified high-risk transactions and maintain a record of actions taken on referred transaction reviews for improved internal audit ability of the program.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-4__yBeZYF">e. <u class="ph u">Risk Assessment (RA)</u>, together with results from the DM Application, assess and report on the overall "health" of a DoD organization's purchase card program. RA allows users to monitor risks associated with their purchase card program. Users assess the risk of their purchase card program by monitoring certain risk controls on a cycle-by-cycle basis. This monitoring is accomplished through the following components within the RA Application: controls, dashboards, and quarterly reports.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-4__p__Toc212456300">f. PCOLS automatically un-provisions, or removes users from their PCOLS roles in EMMA when their retirements or separations are reported to the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS). DEERS receives personnel information updates from the DoD services and agencies on a regular basis.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-4__qsZVHx">g. As discussed in Section 2-2, PCOLS users are responsible for completing DAU GLG005, Purchase Card Online System (PCOLS) prior to GPC appointment and GPC account issuance. DAU GL 005 provides comprehensive role-based PCOLS training and assists in understanding how to utilize the preceding applications in providing oversight of your GPC Program.</p>

      <p class="p Normal">If, as a result of findings from a surveillance visit, or by any other means, the A/OPC discovers a CH or BO has violated GPC procedures, the A/OPC shall document the violation and take action to resolve the noncompliance to include, if necessary, retraining of the CH or BO and/or temporarily suspending the CH or BO’s GPC privileges. Any determinations to cancel or permanently suspend a CH or BO account shall be made by the Level 2 A/OPC, CCO or designee (e.g. Level 3 or 4 A/OPC), and their findings forwarded to the CH or BO’s supervisor. Continual violation of GPC procedures by an individual CH or BO shall result in termination of GPC privileges. A/OPCs shall verify that all potentially fraudulent and erroneous transactions that have been identified are disputed and properly resolved. Evidence of deliberate abuse shall be referred to the CH’s and/or BO’s Commander by the CCO for appropriate action in accordance with the Uniform Code of Military Justice or
         civilian disciplinary rules. Evidence of fraud or other criminal activity shall be referred, by the Commander/CCO, to the appropriate investigative body (e.g. Office of the Inspector General (OIG), Army Audit Agency (AAA)) or other investigative body for a follow up investigation. The violation and action taken shall be documented in the A/OPC’s files.</p>

        Billing Officials</h3>
    <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. Nomination, selection, and appointment of BOs and CHs are in
            accordance with DOD Charge Card Guidebook Chapters A.1.1 and A.3.
            A/OPCs must receive written and signed approval from the BO/CH’s
            supervisory chain of command before initiating their appointment
            process. BOs must successfully complete the required GPC training to
            be appointed as an Approving/Billing Official. BOs should be in the
            supervisory chain of command of the CH. The BO will not be
            subordinate in grade or rank to their CHs to mitigate undue
            influence. There are no exceptions to this policy.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. CHs must successfully complete the required GPC training to be
            delegated procurement authority <strong class="ph b">prior</strong> to receiving their
            card.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. The BO is also a Certifying Officer within the context of the Army
            GPC program, except for pay and confirm proponents. The Certifying
            Officer’s minimum qualifications and eligibility are further
            discussed in DoD FMR Volume 5, Chapter 33. Billing officials are
            responsible for the accuracy of payments, including designation of
            the proper appropriation(s) or other funds certified to the paying
            office and disbursing officer. BOs are financially responsible for
            any illegal, improper, or incorrect payment as a result of an
            inaccurate or misleading certification. To certify GPC invoices for
            payment by DFAS, the BO must be appointed as and accept the
            responsibilities of a Certifying Officer using the DD Form 577
            generated in JAM.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. Approving Officials (AOs) follow pay and confirm procedures and
            are not appointed as Certifying Officers, such as Air Force
            personnel under the Army program.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. GPC Delegation of Authority and appointment letters will clearly
            state the duties of the program participant, any dollar limit of the
            procurement authority (when applicable), and any limitations on the
            scope of authority to be exercised other than those contained in
            applicable law or regulation. All delegates/appointees must
            countersign their letters electronically in JAM to acknowledge they
            understand and concur with their GPC program responsibilities prior
            to establishing any accounts in the bank’s EAS.</p>
        <p class="p List1">f. A/OPCs will maintain and monitor all delegations, appointments
            letters, and training certificates electronically in JAM. If
            electronic versions are available, the Level 4 A/OPC is not required
            to maintain a hard copy. Audit agencies can request access to PIEE
            modules when required. Ensure military and civilian out-processing
            checklists include a mandatory A/OPC sign-off for BOs and CHs. </p>
        <p class="p List1">g. <strong class="ph b">Receiving a GPC</strong>. Standard practice is to have the card
            mailed to the CH’s work address in accordance with the GSA
            SmartPay®3 contract. Using a CH’s home address may be a fraud
            indicator and should not be a normal practice. However, there are
            situations where an alternate address, including the CH’s home
            address, may be valid. Whether the card is mailed to the CH’s work
            address or an alternate address, the CH must maintain the physical
            security of the card. Examples of alternate address uses include,
            but are not limited to, the following:</p>
        <p class="p">1) When an A/OPC wants all cards mailed to the A/OPC’s work address,
            and then the A/OPC provides each card to the new CH’s work
            location.</p>
        <p class="p">2) When the A/OPC feels it is more reliable to have the card mailed
            to the A/OPC’s work address and then sent by express mail to a CH’s
            work address overseas.</p>
        <p class="p">3) When the organization has a policy that all cards will be sent to
            the work address of the responsible BO, who will then deliver each
            card to the CH in person or to the CH’s work address.</p>
        <p class="p">4) When the CH will not be at the work location (duty station) for an
            extended period (COVID-19 stay-at-home orders would be one such
            example), the CH’s home address could be used. If the CH’s home
            address is used for card delivery, a note or memorandum for record
            must be added to the account notes stating why the home address was
            used.</p>

      <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Card Account Limits</strong>. Each card account has a single purchase limit
and a cycle or monthly limit. In most cases, the single purchase limit is the
micro-purchase threshold. The cycle limit is determined by the anticipated
spending needs of the cardholder.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Managing Account Limits</strong>. Each managing account has a cycle limit
and a credit limit. The cycle limit is the sum of the monthly limits of all
cardholders under the managing account. The credit limit is three times the
managing account’s cycle limit.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Establishing Credit Limits</strong>. The requiring activity establishes the
credit limit, based on the organization and the user’s anticipated spending
needs. The limits should be set at a level commensurate with historical
spending, anticipated requirements, and available funding. Limits should not be
based on unlikely contingencies. The A/OPC approves requested limits and inputs
the single purchase limit when creating the card account. The A/OPC then
communicates the credit limits to the RM, who inputs the CH’s credit limit and
the BO’s cycle and credit limit. RMs also establish the default and alternate
lines of accounting for the proper designation of appropriation.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Updating Credit Limits</strong>. The single purchase, cycle, and credit
limits can be changed as necessary to meet operational needs. The A/OPC inputs
changes to the single purchase limit. The RM inputs cycle and credit limit
changes. RMs must notify the Level 4 A/OPC of any cycle or credit limit changes
to a BO or CH account.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. Only cardholders with a continuing need to use the GPC will retain their
card and appointment. At least 60 calendar days prior to reassignment,
separation, or retirement, the CH or BO should notify the A/OPC of their change
in status and begin to transition their duties and files over to another
appointed organization representative. The BO must advise the Level 4 A/OPC when
a CH no longer has a continuing need to use the card or when the CH transfers to
other duties or organizations, retires, or leaves Government service.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. The Level 4 A/OPC will terminate the CH’s or BO’s appointment in JAM and
close the account in the servicing bank. The physical card must be destroyed,
and its destruction must be confirmed in writing. When a cardholder account is
terminated or closed, the cardholder will surrender the GPC and submit the
account documentation to the BO. The BO will perform an in-depth surveillance of
the cardholder’s records within 30 calendar days of termination or closure.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. The BO will ensure all outstanding transactions (charges and/or credits)
have cleared the bank and the card has been destroyed. When a BO vacates their

Financial Management prior to vacating the position. When a BO requests
termination of their managing account, all CHs will surrender their GPC and
submit the account documentation to the BO. The BO will perform an in-depth
surveillance of the CH’s records within 30 calendar days of termination. When

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_5-5__Toc101163526">a. <strong class="ph b">Liability</strong>. Billing officials are personally and
pecuniarily liable for the full amount of any improper payments resulting from
misuse, abuse, or unauthorized purchases of the GPC, in accordance with 31 USC
3528. Strict pecuniary liability applies when there is an erroneous (illegal,
improper, or incorrect) payment. GPC CHs are pecuniarily liable for erroneous
payments that result from the negligent performance of duties, up to one month’s
pay. All accountable officials are required to comply with DoD regulations,
policies, and procedures, including standard operating procedures. Failure to
act in accordance with such regulations, policies, and procedures is generally
considered evidence of negligence. Following orders from superiors that are
contrary to regulations, policies, and procedures, is no defense to negligence
or bad faith. A heavy workload or a lack of experience, supervision, or
training, is not a factor in determining relief from liability.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_5-5__Toc101163528">b. Use of the GPC by a CH to make an unauthorized purchase is
the liability of the Government. However, the installation/organization is
responsible for taking appropriate action against the CH including efforts to
recover the funds.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. The intentional use of the GPC for other than official Government business
may be considered an attempt to commit fraud against the U.S. Government. Misuse
may result in immediate cancellation of an individual's card, financial
liability, and negative administrative and/or disciplinary action against the CH
and, if warranted, against the BO. Any misuse of the GPC is subject to criminal,
civil, Uniform Code of Military Justice, administrative, and disciplinary
actions as appropriate.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Cardholders</strong>. DoD FMR Volume 5, Chapter 5, paragraph 1.1.2 defines a
CH as a Departmental Accountable Official (DAO). DAOs are accountable officials
that provide information, data, or services that certifying officers rely on to
certify vouchers. DoD Directive 7000.14-R imposes financial liability for
negligent performance of the CH’s duties. DAOs will be personally and
pecuniarily liable for erroneous payments that result from the negligent
performance of duties.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Billing Officials</strong>. 31 USC 3528 provides for personal and pecuniary
liability for improper payments resulting from misuse/abuse of the purchase card
for Certifying Officials. The BO meets the definition for Certifying Officer in
the DoD FMR; as such, the BO is financially liable for improper payments
resulting from misuse or abuse. The act of certifying a billing statement for
payment makes the BO financially responsible for illegal, improper, or incorrect
payment due to an inaccurate or misleading certification. Consequently, a BO who
knowingly makes a false certification may be asked to repay the Government for
the items or service purchased. If unsure about certification, BOs should
contact the supporting Level 4 A/OPC for guidance.</p>
      <p class="p List1">f. <strong class="ph b">SCO Oversight</strong>. The SCO and/or CCO have responsibility for the
operation of the GPC program for their activity. The SCO is responsible for
establishing effective internal controls that will ensure the appropriate
management, operation, and oversight of the local GPC program. The SCO must
establish and maintain a command climate to prevent the requiring activity from
exercising undue influence over the actions of a cardholder. The SCO will
establish local policies and procedures identifying informal and formal
disciplinary actions to be taken in the event of noncompliance, fraud, misuse,
and abuse. Disciplinary actions should be based on the severity and frequency of
the infraction and can range from informal actions (such as written or verbal
counseling) to demotion, removal, or potential criminal prosecution.</p>
      <p class="p List1">g. <strong class="ph b">Investigation Required</strong>. Commands must be notified when evidence of
fraud or other criminal activity is identified. Evidence of deliberate abuse
will be referred to the CH’s and/or BO’s command for appropriate action. The
investigation must provide the Army employee or military member with an
opportunity to rebut the presumed liability.

            from the Level 4 A/OPC, through the Level 3, to the Level 2 point of
            contact. In accordance with DoD business practices, U.S. Bank will
            automatically suspend BO accounts under the following
            conditions:</p>
        <p class="p">1) BO’s account goes over 60 days past due (90 days after the billing
            date). The managing account and all card accounts under it are
            suspended until the delinquent payment has posted.</p>
        <p class="p">2) BO’s account goes over 180 days past due (210 days after the
            billing date). All managing accounts assigned under the Level 4
            agent are suspended until delinquent payment has posted. The
            delinquent managing account is permanently closed (T9).</p>
        <p class="p">3) BO’s account has more than 20 open card and/or checking accounts.
            The managing account is suspended unless a waiver has been approved

        <p class="p">4) Before reopening a closed account due to a delinquent payment, the
            Level 3 and/or 4 A/OPC will document that U.S. Bank received full
            payment. Only the Army Level 2 may reopen suspended accounts prior
            to payment being received by U.S. Bank. Accounts will be closed
            permanently if more than two suspensions occur within a 12-month
            period. Only the Army Level 2 A/OPC may approve waivers to this

    <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. CHs are responsible for properly using and safeguarding their GPC.
            CHs must take appropriate precautions comparable to those taken to
            secure personal checks, credit cards, or cash. CHs must maintain the
            physical security of the card to prevent compromise. The card should
            never be surrendered, except when the account is going to be
            cancelled. Additionally, the account number should not be released
            to anyone other than the vendor processing the transaction.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Lost or stolen cards</strong>. The CH must promptly report lost,
            stolen, or compromised cards to the issuing bank, BO, and Level 4
            A/OPC. The servicing bank will immediately block the account from
            accepting additional charges.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. Only the designated CH has authority to make purchases with their
            GPC. The card is not to be used as a company card (e.g., during a
            CH’s absence, someone other than the CH borrows the card to make a
            purchase). Use of a GPC by multiple persons is prohibited.</p>
        <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_5-7__Toc532909305">d. In addition to corrective or disciplinary
            action, military personnel who misuse their GPC may have their

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. Purchases below the MPT are exempt from the Competition in Contracting
Act, Buy American Act, Economy Act, Service Contract Labor Standards Act, Wage
Rates Requirements Act, and the Small Business Set-Aside Program. Nothing in
this chapter exempts a cardholder from using the proper contracting channels
when making purchases exceeding the MPT.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. Requiring activities must perform acquisition planning to identify
procurement needs; consider strategic sourcing vehicles (e.g., BPAs, CHESS,
GSA); and initiate procurement actions with sufficient lead time to buy
appropriate products at the right price from the right suppliers in a timely
manner. Requirements and logistics personnel should avoid issuing requirements
on an urgent basis or with unrealistic delivery or performance schedules, since
it generally restricts competition and increases prices. Ordering from existing
contracts (e.g., BPAs, CHESS, or GSA FSS) can only be done by an appointed
ordering official, including purchases below the MPT.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. Purchase requirements exceeding the MPTs or delegations of authority
established in Tables 1-2 and 1-3 must be referred to a contracting office.
Splitting requirements into smaller parts to avoid formal contracting
procedures, competition requirements, or to keep spending limitations under the
MPT is prohibited. The GPC may be used for non-personal recurring services
performed at regular intervals; however, recurring service requirements
estimated to exceed the MPT per FY are not authorized.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. Cardholders must use the mandatory sources identified in Chapter 9 before
deciding to use commercial sources. GPC micro-purchases should be distributed
equitably among qualified suppliers, with special consideration paid to
supporting the installation AbilityOne Base Supply Center, and local, small, and
small disadvantaged businesses.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. Cardholders are responsible for procuring green products and services
under the Green Procurement Program as prescribed by Executive Order 13834 and
by DoD and Army policies. Green procurement applies to the purchase of recovered
materials, energy and water efficient products, alternative fuels and fuel
efficiency, bio-based products, non-ozone depleting substances, environmentally
preferable products and services, and toxic and hazardous chemicals. The
following are mandatory Green Procurement purchases: paper, toner, office
products, office recycle containers, and office trash cans. The following are
the only exceptions to purchasing green products and services: the pricing is
considered unreasonable; item/service does not meet reasonable standards; or
item/service will not meet the time frame needed. Exceptions must be documented.
Recommended sources for green products are AbilityOne, FedMall, and GSA
Advantage.</p>
      <p class="p List1">f. <strong class="ph b">OCONUS Units</strong>. For the use of the GPC outside the U.S., CHs must
follow policy in accordance with DFARS 213.301(2). To ensure the CH does not
exceed $25,000 for OCONUS purchases, the total purchase price must include the
currency conversion rate prior to making the purchase. If a CH makes a purchase
from an OCONUS location for use OCONUS and the vendor is located in the U.S.,
this would be considered a reach-back purchase and the MPT for a reach-back
purchase is $10,000. Any reach-back purchase over $10,000 is subject to
simplified acquisition procedures and should be sent to the contracting office
to make the purchase.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_6-1__OLE_LINK21">g. For purchases made in the Contiguous United States (CONUS)
for use overseas, the CH must contact their local Director of Logistics Traffic
Management Office for assistance regarding transportation and packaging
requirements and/or instructions prior to contacting the vendor. CHs must ensure
the final price includes all costs associated with the mode of transportation
and packaging selected to the destination country, customs import duties, and
any other charges that may accrue. See DoD Directive 4500.54-E, DoD Foreign
Clearance Program for compliance with host nation customs requirements.</p>
      <p class="p List1">h. <strong class="ph b">OCONUS Value-Added Tax (VAT) Forms</strong>. The cost of the VAT can be
charged on the GPC. Cardholders must contact their AOPC for local guidance and
procedures involving the usage of the VAT form. The following VAT forms are
provided on the GPC PAM website for information purposes only:</p>
      <p class="p">1) <a class="xref" href="https://www.companyformationbelgium.com/vat-registration-belgium" target="_blank">Belgium VAT</a>

      <p class="p">4) For all other countries, contact the local Morale, Welfare and Recreation
(MWR) office.</p>
      <p class="p List1">i. <strong class="ph b">Terms and Conditions</strong>. Cardholders do not have the authority to
approve or sign written vendor terms and conditions. Cardholders will consult
their A/OPC or local legal office for additional guidance.</p>
      <p class="p List1">j. <strong class="ph b">Convenience Check Accounts</strong>. The management controls, procedures,
and restrictions included in this regulation also apply to the use of
convenience checking accounts. Convenience checks are an alternative only when
the GPC is not feasible and the activity has evaluated all alternatives and
determined the checks as the most advantageous. Before a check is issued, the
requiring organization must document their effort to find a merchant that
accepts the GPC. Convenience checks must not be used for more than one half of
the MPT per Public Law 115-91. See Chapter 10.</p>

        <p class="p List1">a. Effective August 13, 2020, FAR Case 2018-017 amends the FAR to
            implement section 889(a)(1(B) of the John S. McCain NDAA for Fiscal
            Year 2019 which prohibits Federal agencies from purchasing products
            or services from entities that use covered equipment or services as
            a substantial or essential component of any system, or as critical
            technology as part of any system, regardless of whether that usage
            is in performance of work under Federal contract. <a class="xref" href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/asda/dpc/cp/cyber/gpc.html" target="_blank">DPC 889 Memorandum dated September 9, 2020</a>
            requires recording of specific 889 designations in the bank’s EAS
            for <strong class="ph b">all</strong> GPC transactions. <a class="xref" href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/asda/dpc/ce/pc/docs/guides-docs/DPC-CeB_Memo-Recording_889_Designation_and_ETO_Values(GPC-2022-02).pdf" target="_blank">DPC GPC Memorandum dated June 29, 2022</a>
            provides further guidance on completing the required fields. CHs
            must record 889 Designation and Emergency Type Operation (ETO)
            information in the bank’s EAS.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. 889 Representation. Federal law requires CHs to obtain a current
            889 representation for each transaction and to include the
            representation with their transaction documentation. The
            representation contains the language from FAR 52.204-26, Covered
            Telecommunications Equipment or Services-Representation. CHs may
            obtain the vendor’s 889 representation by using one of the following
            methods:</p>
        <p class="p">1) Log into the <a class="xref" href="https://www.sam.gov/" target="_blank">System for Award Management (SAM.gov)
            website</a>. Locate the vendor’s entity registration and review
            FAR 52.204-26, under Reps and Certs.</p>
        <p class="p">2) Use the robotic process automation (RPA) tool to search SAM.gov.
            Send an email to <a class="xref" href="mailto:info@section889request.com" target="_blank">info@section889request.com</a> with the vendor’s
            Unique Entity ID (UEI) or Cage code in the subject line. Do not
            include any text in the body of the email. The RPA will return an
            email with the vendor’s FAR 52.204-26 language, if applicable.</p>
        <p class="p">3) Use the vendor’s completed 889 representation form. The form must
            be dated and signed. Completed forms are valid for 1 year after date
            of signature unless the vendor updates their systems at which time
            the vendor will need to fill out a new 889 form.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. The requirement to obtain an 889 representation does not apply
            under these conditions:</p>
        <p class="p">1) Contract payments. When the GPC is used as a method of payment
            against a contract, the Contracting Officer is responsible for
            ensuring compliance prior to award.</p>
        <p class="p">2) Inter/intra-governmental payments.</p>
        <p class="p">3) SF 182 training payments.</p>
        <p class="p">4) Fraudulent (external) transactions.</p>
        <p class="p">5) Fees (e.g., convenience check fees).</p>
        <p class="p">6) Refunds and transaction credits/discounts.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. Pursuant to DoD policy, bank EAS entries must indicate how the
            vendor’s 889 representation was obtained. CHs must enter one of the
            allowable codes in Table 6-2 in the following locations in the
            bank’s EAS, as applicable:</p>
        <p class="p">1) CHs creating manual orders will use the “889 Designation” field in
            Order Management.</p>
        <p class="p">2) CHs receiving editable eOrders will use the “889 Designation”
            field in Order Management.</p>
        <p class="p">3) CHs receiving non-editable eOrders will use the “889 Designation”
            field in the Custom Fields tab in Transaction Management.</p>
        <p class="p">4) For 100% of transactions, CH must enter appropriate 889
            designation in the bank’s EAS.</p>
        <p class="p">BOs must check for bank EAS entries when reconciling. BOs and A/OPCs
            must monitor 889 compliance during DM case dispositions and should
            use the “Cyber Security Non-Compliance” finding for cases without an
            889 bank EAS entry once CI 193 is implemented.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. <u class="ph u">Use of Third- Party Payment Processors</u>: In no instance are
Cardholders (CHs) authorized to establish an account when using a third-party
payment processor, as doing so could require acceptance of or agreement to terms
and conditions or result in commitment of funds that have not been legally
allocated for purchases. Transactions using third-party payment processors are
considered high risk, as all available transaction data may not be completely
passed to the issuing bank (which can adversely affect reporting,
reconciliation, and oversight, including data mining (detection of improper card
use)), and may adversely affect transaction dispute terms and processes, among
other considerations.</p>
      <p class="p">When selecting merchants to fulfill requirements, CHs shall use the following
procedures:</p>
      <p class="p">1) Minimize use of third-party payment processors to the maximum extent
practicable.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Ask if the merchant would require use of a third-party payment processor,
if there is any doubt regarding merchant use of one.</p>
      <p class="p">3) If it is still found necessary to purchase from a merchant that requires
uses a third-party payment processor, CHs and A/BOs must ensure adequate
supporting documentation clearly showing there was a detailed review of the
purchase, and that purchase from a merchant requiring use of a third-party
payment processor was unavoidable.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. Additionally, Component Program Managers must ensure CHs are:</p>
      <p class="p">1) Appropriately trained on DoD GPC Third-Party Payment Policy; DoD GPC
Policy for Non-DoD e-Commerce Platforms; related Component policy; and
third-party payment processor requirements and risks in OMB Circular A-123,
Appendix B; and GSA Smart Bulletin No. 023 entitled “GSA SmartPay-Third Party
Payment Processors”.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Never authorized to establish an account when using third-party payment
services for processing GPC payments.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. GPC oversight personnel and CHs should be aware that in accordance with
GSA Smart Bulletin No. 23, third-party payment policy does not apply to
e-commerce platforms or brick-and-mortar merchants that do not accept payment
using third-party payment processors. See Attachment 2 for additional
guidance.</p>

    <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. Centrally billed GPC accounts are exempt from state tax in every state but require tax exemption forms in certain states. See the <a class="xref" href="https://smartpay.gsa.gov/smarttax" target="_blank">GSA SmartPay website</a> for more information.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. For purchases within the U.S., CHs are responsible for notifying vendors of the tax exemption and ensuring no sales tax is included in their purchase, except where applicable. Cardholders must inform the merchant that the purchase is for official U.S. Government purposes and, therefore, is not subject to state or local sales tax.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. A/OPCs may request embossing of the statement “U.S. GOVT TAX EXEMPT” when ordering a GPC.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Exceptions</strong>. Some states (e.g., Hawaii, Illinois) levy a General Excise Tax (GET) on businesses selling tangible personal property which is allowed to be passed on to the Federal Government.

      <span class="ph autonumber">6-6.</span> Surcharges</h3>
  <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. Surcharges are fees that a retailer adds to the cost of a purchase
      when a customer uses a credit card. As a result of the settlement between
      a class of retailers and the brands on January 27, 2013, merchants in the
      U.S. and U.S. Territories are permitted to impose a surcharge on
      cardholders when a credit card is used. Not all merchants impose a
      surcharge, and some states (e.g., Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Maine,
      Massachusetts, New York, Oklahoma, Texas, and Utah) prohibit merchant
      surcharges. Cardholders who receive a surcharge in any of the
      above-mentioned states should report the merchant to the proper State
      authority.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. Cardholders are required to be notified in advance if a merchant will
      impose a surcharge. Merchants must also include the surcharge fee on all
      receipts. Surcharges are allowable up to 4%. The limits vary by brand and
      by merchant discount rate. See <a class="xref" href="https://smartpay.gsa.gov/sites/default/files/downloads/FINAL-%20SP_SmartBulletin_No._017-Surcharges_Revised_102119.pdf" target="_blank">GSA SmartPay Bulletin #17</a>. If a merchant is
      imposing a surcharge, the CH may consider choosing another merchant that
      offers the same or similar item(s) to avoid paying the surcharge.</p>

CHs will process and route the document for signature prior to making a purchase. This document will not be used for training (SF 182), MIPR, contract payments, and delivery orders/purchase orders.

  <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. Personnel entrusted with the acquisition of Government property are responsible for its proper custody, safekeeping, and accountability in accordance with AR 710-2 and AR 735-5 (e.g., computer equipment, software, televisions, and large purchases).

      <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">GPC Accountable Property Procedures</strong>.</p>
      <p class="p">1) CH will ensure that the Accountable Property Officer (APO) reviews each purchase request form or the applicable financial system prior to making the purchase.</p>
      <p class="p">2) CH will provide purchase receipt to APO within 5 days of obtaining the receipt.</p>
      <p class="p">3) When performing monitoring and oversight reviews, APOs must assess whether CHs provided the GPC receipts to the APO.</p>
      <p class="p">4) When applicable, contract payment CHs must review and comply with WAWF Invoicing, Receipt, Acceptance and Property Transfer module in accordance with DFARS 232.7002, 232.7003, and 252.232-7003. See DoD Charge Card Guidebook Section A.4.4.1.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Exemptions</strong>. Consumable items, services, and SF 182 training payments do not require APO approval. A consumable item is any item that loses its identity or is consumed in use (e.g., office supplies, paper, and batteries).</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">Payment Delinquency Monitoring</strong>. A/OPCs must track managing account
certification after the end of the billing cycle and confirm whether the
payments processed. A/OPCs can use the Managing Account Approval Status and
Certification and Payment Report reports to identify accounts that have not been
certified. The servicing bank may send reports of delinquencies and potential
past due accounts. A/OPCs can also use the Past Due report in the bank’s EAS to
identify delinquent accounts. Past due notices (delinquencies over 30 days) must
be handled immediately. GPC stakeholders must work together to research and
correct any delinquency immediately. Delinquencies that are 60 days past due are
suspended as outlined in paragraph 5-6.b. The Army goal is to pay all accounts
on time. The Army maintains a zero tolerance for any percentage of receivables
over 180 days past due.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. The A/OPC will monitor account certifications and may suspend any account
that is not certified within 5 business days. If the A/OPC suspends an account,
once the account is certified, the A/OPC may reinstate the account. If the bank
suspends an account, once the account is certified and paid, the account is
automatically reinstated. The request to reinstate a suspended account due to
non-certification, must include an explanation of the delay in certification and
a plan to avoid future delays. If the account has been suspended for late
certification more than once, any request to reinstate the account must come
from the activity responsible for the account.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Cardholder Statement Reconciliation and Certification</strong>. Cardholders
must match and approve transactions throughout the month to ensure accuracy and
identify and resolve any funding errors. If a charged amount is incorrect, the
CH must contact the vendor to resolve the discrepancy and may dispute the
transaction, if necessary. Cardholders must also upload transaction
documentation throughout the month to ensure BO visibility of purchase
information. If the statement is correct at the end of the billing cycle, the CH
must approve the statement within three business days of the billing cycle end
date. For Army agencies that do not utilize the bank's EAS for monthly
certification, per the DoD FMR, Vol 10 Chapter 23, Figure 23-2, the CH must
complete a monthly certification statement as part of their reconciliation
process.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Billing Official Certification</strong>. BOs must review their CHs’
transactions and ensure that all purchases are legal, proper, and correct.
Billing officials must final-approve their CHs’ transactions and certify the
billing statement within five business days of the billing cycle end date. If
the BO finds a questionable transaction, they should not certify the statement.
They should contact their A/OPC for further guidance. Billing officials must
certify in order for DFAS to process the payment and the bank to receive and
post the payment. Time certification is essential in order to avoid delinquency
and interest from late payments. For Army agencies that do not utilize the
bank’s EAS for monthly certification, per DoD FMR, Vol 10 Chapter 23, Figures
23-1 and 23-2, the BO must complete a monthly review checklist and certification
statement.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Confirm and Pay</strong>. The Army certifies invoices for payment after all
purchased items have been confirmed. This procedure is called “Confirm and Pay.”
Before certifying the billing statement, BOs should review the uploaded
transaction documentation to confirm that the items arrived or services were
performed. Each BO should ensure all transactions are reconciled and approved
for payment, receipt is verified, and all supporting documentation is loaded in
the bank’s EAS prior to certification. Any transactions that cannot be
reconciled and approved for payment, will not be approved in the bank’s EAS by
the BO. ANG and certain other Army accounts supporting the Air Force certify
invoices for payment following the Pay and Confirm model. For ANG payment
related guidance, see DAFI 64-117.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">6-10.</span> Disputes, Defective Items and Fraudulent Transactions</h3>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. Cardholders must protect the Army’s interest by initiating disputes when
applicable. Failure to do so can result in administrative or disciplinary
action. The steps below outline the process for disputing a charge:</p>
      <p class="p">1) Attempt to resolve any issue directly with the merchant prior to
initiating a dispute.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Document all available information and attempts to correct the dispute.
This information will become part of the supporting documentation.</p>
      <p class="p">3) Initiate the dispute in the bank’s EAS (only after failing to resolve the
issue with the merchant) as early as possible, but within 90 days from the
posted date of the transaction.</p>
      <p class="p">4) Respond to any bank requests for additional information.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. If items or services purchased are faulty or defective, the CH will obtain
a replacement or repair of the item or re-performance of the service as soon as
possible. If the merchant refuses to credit, replace, repair the faulty item, or
re-perform the service to satisfaction, the CH will dispute the transaction.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. Transaction errors, such as duplicate billing, non-receipt or cancellation
of supplies or services, returned supplies, invoice amount discrepancies,
transaction paid by other means (e.g., split payments w/another organization),
must be handled initially between the cardholder and the merchant. If the
merchant is unwilling to accommodate a resolution, the cardholder will file a
dispute in the bank’s EAS. If a dispute is resolved in favor of the cardholder,
a credit will be placed on the cardholder’s statement. If the dispute is
resolved in favor of the merchant, a letter will be sent to the cardholder
explaining the decision and, since the charge was already paid, no further
action will be taken.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. If the CH discovers fraudulent transactions (e.g., use of a lost or stolen
card) on the statement, the CH will immediately contact the bank’s Customer
Service Department. The CH should also notify his A/OPC and BO of any fraudulent
activity. If fraudulent activity is confirmed (which means a third party has
gained access to the account), the bank will terminate the account and replace
it with a new account number. All account information will transfer to the new
account and the CH will continue to work with the servicing bank to resolve the
fraudulent transactions.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. The servicing bank must ensure that adequate controls are in place to
ensure the security of transaction data within their EAS. Only the CH or BO can
approve, dispute, or reallocate purchase card transactions. The servicing bank
must ensure that adequate controls are in place within their data warehouse to
preclude anyone other than the BO from accessing, making changes and certifying
the monthly billing statement.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">Card Misuse by Cardholder</strong>. Charges that involve misuse or abuse by
the CH are not disputable with the bank. If the transaction was processed in
accordance with established controls (e.g., within the purchase limits, not from
a merchant with a blocked Merchant Category Code, then the bank has fulfilled
its responsibilities under the contract, and the Government is obligated to make
payment for the transaction. The Government will seek recourse, as prescribed in
Chapter 13, Disciplinary actions, and seek restitution from the employee as a
result of their improper misuse or abuse.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Sales Tax</strong>. If a charge involves sales tax erroneously invoiced by
the merchant, the amount of the tax cannot be disputed. The CH should make an
effort to obtain a credit from the merchant. If a credit is not obtained, the CH
should inform and request assistance from the A/OPC. The CH should seek
restitution via the guidance provided by the <a class="xref" href="https://smartpay.gsa.gov/smarttax" target="_blank">GSA SmartPay Tax Exemption website</a>. The CH should
document the file accordingly.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Shipping Costs</strong>. If a charge involves shipping costs erroneously
invoiced by the merchant, the amount of the erroneous shipping costs cannot be
disputed. The CH should try to obtain a credit for the amount of the
transportation costs from the merchant. If a credit is not obtained, the CH
should inform and request assistance from the servicing bank. The CH should
document the file accordingly.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Convenience Checks</strong>. There is no convenience check dispute process
within the bank. Any concerns with a purchase made by check must be resolved
directly with the merchant. The checkwriter is responsible for securing
restitution and/or credit for disputed purchases. The checkwriter will notify
the A/OPC and request assistance to resolve disputes if necessary. Each
organization is responsible for checks written on the account, unless it is
determined fraudulent activity is involved.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Third-party Payments</strong>. If a dispute with a merchant involves a

  <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. BOs must review LOAs selected by the CH as part of the review, reconciliation, and certification process. Payments are generally rejected as a result of missing or incorrect LOAs. The Army’s financial management system will also reject missing or incorrect LOAs, requiring the finance office to make corrections or complete a manual payment in the system. When this happens, the A/OPC will notify the BO when a payment has been rejected in the system. The BO must immediately contact their RM for assistance in obligating funds in the system and processing the manual payment. For GFEBS-funded accounts, follow the GFEBS manual payment process.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Steps for processing manual payments for non-GFEBS-funded accounts</strong>.</p>
      <p class="p">1) Print the managing account statement from the servicing bank’s EAS (located under Account Information).</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">6-13.</span> File Retention</h3>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. GPC transaction documentation must be retained for six years in accordance
with FAR 4.805 and DoD Charge Card Guidebook Section A.1.14. Billing officials
are responsible for ensuring that record retention requirements are met. GPC
transactions with foreign military sales (FMS) funding must follow the retention
guidance in DoD FMR Volume 15, Chapter 6, and ensure the FMS documents are
retained for 10 years from the date of final case closure.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Uploading Supporting Documentation</strong>. CHs must upload all transaction
supporting documentation in the bank’s EAS. The uploaded documentation is the
CH’s official purchase file. If the complete file is uploaded in the EAS, CHs do
not need to maintain a duplicate hardcopy or electronic file. For purchases that
do not have uploaded documentation, the CH or BO must retain the corresponding
hardcopy or electronic files for six years.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Corrective Action</strong>. When documentation is not retained in accordance
with the GPC file retention policy, A/OPCs must evaluate the CH/BO’s record
retention processes and develop corrective action plans with target completion
dates to prevent recurrence. A/OPCs should take disciplinary action as necessary
for negligent CHs (e.g., suspending card accounts).</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. FAR 4.805 provides the following guidance on file storage: “Agencies must
prescribe procedures for the handling, storing, and disposing of contract
files…These procedures must take into account documents held in all types of
media. Agencies may change the original medium to facilitate storage as long as
the requirements of the part, law, and other regulations are satisfied. The
process used to create and store records must record and reproduce the original
document, including signatures and other written and graphic images completely,
accurately, and clearly. Data transfer, storage, and retrieval procedures must
protect the original data from alteration. Unless law or other regulations
require signed originals to be kept, they may be destroyed after the responsible
agency official verifies that record copies on alternate media and copies
reproduced from the record copy are accurate, complete, and clear
representations of the originals.”</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. Original disbursing office records (BO or Certifying Officer), along with
CH supporting documents in electronic format, negate the need for the CH to
store duplicate hardcopy documents.</p>
      <p class="p List1">f. Electronic record storage requires adequate controls to ensure the digital
images accurately represent the corresponding paper documentation and to detect
changes to an original digital image. In addition, electronic storage must be in
a centrally managed location that has an established backup process.</p>
      <p class="p List1">g. See 6-2.e for GPC transaction documentation and disbursing office records.
For additional examples of documents classified as disbursing office records,
see DoD FMR Volume 5, Chapter 15, 150803.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_6-13__OLE_LINK9">h. Receipts are considered supporting documents for the certified
billing statement. Original receipts are preferred; however, printed electronic
forms or copies of an itemized receipt are acceptable. The receipt must be
legible and indicate vendor’s name and address, date of the purchase, and paid
by credit card or zero amount due. Goods must be itemized/detailed with the item
description, quantity, price, and extended price. The BO maintains these records
in physical possession, or when appropriate, transfers them to a records holding
area. However, if certifying electronically, the CH and BO may rely on the
servicing bank’s EAS for supporting documentation. Original records are
considered Government property and may not be removed from Government control by
the BO for any reason.</p>
      <p class="p List1">i. <strong class="ph b">Appointment Letters</strong>. Delegation of authority letters and GPC
appointment letters, executed by both the appointer and the appointee, will be
retained in PIEE/JAM for six years after the delegation has been terminated
through personnel action such as the appointee’s separation, retirement, or
transfer.</p>
      <p class="p List1">j. A/OPCs must retain any paper-based or email requests relating to new
account issuance and maintenance for six years after the date of account
issuance or update.</p>
      <p class="p List1">k. Data residing in the bank’s EAS is maintained by the bank for six years.
Reports may be retrieved from the bank’s EAS for the previous two years. Reports
covering data for periods beyond the previous two years are available from the

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. The GPC may be used to purchase non-personal services up to the applicable
MPT, whether recurring or non-recurring. If recurring, the requirement is the
total estimated cost per fiscal year. Recurring services estimated to exceed the
MPT per fiscal year will be acquired through the contracting office. Recurring
services are performed at regular intervals and have a demand that can be
accurately predicted on a yearly basis. Non-recurring services involve one-time,
unpredictable, or occasional requirements, and may be purchased with the GPC up
to the MPT whenever a requirement occurs.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. When a CH receives a request to purchase services, it is crucial to
identify whether or not the services are subject to the Service Contract Labor
Standards (SCLS) and determine the applicable MPT.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Services Subject to Service Contract Labor Standards</strong>. Examples
include services performed by carpenters, electricians, mechanics, plumbers,
iron workers, craftsmen, operating engineers, and other laborers. Other examples
include court reporters, administrative assistants, engineering technicians, and
paralegals. To determine whether a service is subject to SCLS, CHs and A/OPCs
can search the Service Contract Act wage determinations in SAM.gov to locate a
list of applicable occupations for a specified state and county.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Services Not Subject to Service Contract Labor Standards</strong>. The
following services are not subject to SCLS:</p>
      <p class="p">1) <strong class="ph b">Professional Services</strong>. Examples include services performed by
architects, engineers, professors, chemists, lawyers, doctors of medicine or
dentistry, and software engineers. These services may include office work
related to operations, teaching, practice of law or medicine, and skilled
services such as computer services, sales, and business management. The primary
duty must be the performance of work by persons requiring knowledge of an
advanced type in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a
prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction or the performance of
work requiring invention, imagination, originality or talent in a recognized
field of artistic or creative endeavor. If unsure, CHs and A/OPCs can search the
Service Contract Act wage determinations in SAM.gov to confirm whether the type
of worker is on the list for the applicable location.</p>

      <p class="p List1">c. If after coordination with the contracting authority for the deployed
area, it is determined the deploying units are not taking their GPCs, these
accounts must be temporarily suspended by the A/OPC, upon notification from the
BO, during the period of deployment. If GPCs are authorized while deployed, the
local RM must make appropriate adjustments to the LOAs, and additional
information must be entered in the servicing bank’s EAS. The BO must notify the
A/OPC in writing if GPCs are authorized while deployed. OCONUS GPCs will be
managed to meet the program requirements of the issuing agency.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Active Component Units</strong>. Units deploying in support of contingency
operations should take their locally issued GPCs with them to use while
deployed. Prior to deployment, A/OPCs must coordinate with the contracting
authority in the contingency area to see if there are special requirements for
using the GPC while deployed in the AOR and ensure the cards' lines of
accounting are properly funded. GPCs are issued through contracting; therefore,
the decision on whether the GPC will be taken to deployed locations will be
determined by the contracting office Level 3 or 4 A/OPCs. Resource Managers do
not determine whether GPCs are taken to deployed locations.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Deploying National Guard (NG) Members</strong>. Deploying NG members may
continue to use their home station GPC up until they arrive at the Mobilization
(MOB) station. The NG home station Level 4 A/OPC deactivates the mobilized
soldier’s GPC account at this point, through temporary closure or termination.
The gaining activity in the new AOR will then determine if the NG member
requires a GPC. If it is determined that the mobilized NG member requires a GPC,
the Level 4 A/OPC in the new AOR will be responsible for issuance and oversight
responsibility of this new GPC account. All GPC accounts (CH and BO) for
mobilized NG members are managed by the Level 4 A/OPC to whom the NG member is
assigned. Cards are to be used in theater for mission essential requirements
only.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">8-1.</span> SF 182 Training Payments (Non-FAR based training actions)</h3>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">References</strong>. 5 USC 4109 gives the head of an agency the authority to
pay for training and makes Training, Education and Professional Development
(TE&amp;PD) services a valid expense of the U.S. Government. DoD FMR Volume 10,
Chapter 12 provides authority for Miscellaneous Payments of TE&amp;PD both as a
direct reimbursement to employee and payment to non-Government sources. DoDI
1400.25, Volume 410 provides policy and conditions to make a Miscellaneous
Payment for TE&amp;PD services directly to a non-Government source. This same
instruction requires specific conditions to be met in order to use the GPC. FAR
13 provides authority for Simplified Acquisition and micro-purchase of services.
DoD policy is to use the GPC to make FMR-based Miscellaneous Payments for
TE&amp;PD services from non-Government sources. Because the preference is to pay
the vendor or educational institution directly as opposed to reimbursing the
employee, the FMR refers to this DoD Instruction. 5 USC 4109 authorizes the head
of an agency, under the regulations prescribed in 5 USC 4118(a)(8), to reimburse
employees for necessary training expenses (e.g., tuition and matriculation fees;
library and laboratory services; purchase or rental of books, materials, and
supplies; and other services or facilities directly related to employee
training). See DoDI 1400.25 Volume 410 for additional information regarding the
appropriate use.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">SF 182</strong>. The SF 182 (Authorization, Agreement, and Certification of
Training) is the authorized and required training obligating document. GPC
payments for commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) training must be accompanied by an
SF 182 or approved equivalent. Authorized training may be provided by Government
or non-Government sources. Each student attending training must complete an SF
182. A single SF 182 must not be used for a group of individuals to attend
training. CHs must include the signed SF 182 or equivalent and a copy of the
training certificate or proof of completion in their file documentation. See
Army Publications for the current version of the SF 182.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. The GPC will be the method of payment for all commercial training
requirements using the SF 182, valued at or below $25,000, in lieu of an
employee reimbursement by miscellaneous payments in accordance with the DoD FMR
Volume 10, Chapter 12, Section 3.23, and DoDI 1400.25, Volume 410. The SF 182 is
not a FAR-based transaction. As such, the MPT for services does not apply to
these types of transactions. DoD has made a determination and uses the GPC to
purchase training authorized by use of a single SF 182 to a cap of $25,000 per
transaction.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. The GPC will be used by CHs (primarily TE&amp;PD Educational Office
personnel) to pay for COTS training and education up to a single purchase limit
of $25,000. See AFARS 5113.270-90(g).</p>
      <p class="p"> 
         <strong class="ph b">Individual Slots in Existing Training Course</strong>. Each slot purchased may
be considered its own transaction, even when paid together. Each student must
have an approved SF 182. Each slot must be below $25,000 per student. CHs may
purchase each slot as a separate transaction or may combine the slots into a
single transaction for the total amount. To be considered COTS, training from
non-Government sources must meet the following criteria:</p>
      <p class="p">1) <strong class="ph b">Regularly scheduled.</strong> The TE&amp;PD event can be found in an
established offering, whether in print or online. The event does not have to be
held on a scheduled date and time if the training provider makes it available at
any time, such as an online course.</p>
      <p class="p">2) <strong class="ph b">Off-the-shelf TE&amp;PD service available to the general public.</strong>
The service is a commercially available TE&amp;PD event or a planned series of
the same event, activity, service, or material, requiring no modification prior
to use. Such training may occur on or off federal property and may include
non-federal employees.</p>
      <p class="p">3) <strong class="ph b">Priced the same for everyone in the same category.</strong> The service is
priced the same per student, course, service, or training space. In other words,
the same event is offered at an equal price to all customers.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">8-2.</span> Tailored Training</h3>
  <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. Tailored training is any training that falls outside of "regularly scheduled," "off-the-shelf," or "priced the same for everyone.” The following are indicators of tailored training:</p>
      <p class="p">1) Creating a new training course.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Adding terms and conditions to a regularly scheduled, COTS training event.</p>
      <p class="p">3) Taking an existing course and tailoring it to be agency-specific (e.g., mission, regulations, policies, personnel, etc.).</p>
      <p class="p">4) Materials and content are tailored specific to the agency.</p>
      <p class="p">5) Typically requires a detailed Statement of Work (SOW) and review/acceptance of deliverable.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. If the Government has a need for tailored training or tailored training materials, the requirement must be placed on a Government contract by a warranted Contracting Officer. See DoD Charge Card Guidebook A.1.3. The GPC may be used as the payment method but not the procurement method. A CH must <strong class="ph b">never</strong> sign any vendor written terms and conditions that would financially bind the Government without proper authority.</p>

   <h3 class="title topictitle3" id="ariaid-title83">
      <span class="ph autonumber">8-3.</span> FAR-based Training Actions</h3>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p">FAR-based training actions are subject to the applicable services MPT. They
are not considered SF 182 payments, and the $25,000 limit does not apply. The
following paragraphs identify the types of training requests that are considered
FAR-based actions:</p>
      <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">Buying an Existing (Not Tailored) Imported Course.</strong> In this case,
the purchase is for the entire COTS course, and the MPT applies to the dollar
value of the all-inclusive total cost of the course (instructor time, materials,
etc.). Depending on the subject matter of the training, these courses may be
considered “professional services.” No SF 182 is needed for individuals.</p>
      <p class="p">1) <strong class="ph b">Example #1</strong>. You are buying a 1-day Myers-Briggs seminar for 35
employees at a total cost of $9,500. The GPC can be used as a PROCUREMENT and
PAYMENT mechanism because it falls within the $10,000 MPT.</p>
      <p class="p">2) <strong class="ph b">Example #2</strong>. You are buying a 3-day mid-career retirement course for
150 participants held at the agency’s headquarters. The cost of the course is
$30,000. Do not take the $30,000 and divide by 150 participants to arrive at a
price per student ($200) and think you can simply pay for 150 separate slots and
split those payments against your SPL. The MPT must be applied to the aggregate
cost in this case, or $30,000. In this case, the cost exceeds the MPT and the
cardholder’s SPL and must be purchased via other formal means (i.e., Contracting
Office / Contracting Officer). The GPC cannot be used for procuring the course
but may be used as a PAYMENT mechanism within the SPL of the CH and agency
policy.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Subscriptions for Group Training Services</strong>. Subscriptions for access
to on-demand training are considered a supply. Cardholders can use the GPC to
pay for subscriptions up to the supply MPT.</p>
      <p class="p">In this case, the purchase is a subscription for access to on-demand
training, and the MPT applies to the dollar value of the total cost of the
subscription. Subscription services for groups or organizations typically set a
threshold or limit to the number of employees who can access training services
via the subscription for the flat subscription cost; the costs are not pro-rated
or adjusted by the number of actual employees that actually access the
training.</p>
      <p class="p">1) <strong class="ph b">Example.</strong> You are buying a subscription to a training vendor’s
on-demand training site for a cost of $9,000. Up to 300 employees can access
on-demand training under the subscription and the cost is not pro-rated based on
actual use. The purchase could be made with the purchase card because it falls
within the $10,000 MPT.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Tailored Training</strong>. The GPC cannot be used to purchase tailored
training.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">8-4.</span> Purchase Training Examples</h3>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. In accordance with current acquisition and financial management policy,
the SF 182 authority is authorized for use only under the following
conditions:</p>
      <p class="p">1) SF 182s are granted to individual employees; and</p>
      <p class="p">2) The individual employees will attend a regularly scheduled, off-the-shelf
course that is available to the public and priced the same for everyone in the
same category (e.g., price per student) and requires no tailoring; and</p>
      <p class="p">3) The GPC is being used to pay the training provider directly instead of
reimbursing the employee.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. If a course is being purchased (e.g., group training), the SF 182
authority does not apply and should not be used. The purchase is a FAR-based
acquisition that generally needs to be sent to the supporting contracting office
for action. Exceptions that allow action by a CH include the following:</p>
      <p class="p">1) The course is priced below the applicable MPT and does not require the CH
to agree to terms and conditions other than price and delivery. The purchase can
be made following micro-purchase procedures; or</p>
      <p class="p">2) The course is available under indefinite delivery contracts not requiring
the GPC Ordering Official CH to agree to terms and conditions other than price
and delivery.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. The following examples demonstrate how to apply the above guidance in
purchasing situations:</p>
      <p class="p">1) <strong class="ph b">Situation 1</strong>. Five individuals each have an approved SF 182
authorizing them to attend leadership training. The cost of the training is
$5,800 per student (seat). <em class="ph i">The training will take place off the
installation</em>. The training is for attendance at a regularly scheduled,
off-the-shelf course that is available to the public and priced the same for
everyone in the same category (e.g., price per student) and requires no
tailoring.</p>
      <p class="p"> 
         <strong class="ph b">Resolution</strong>: The training institution should invoice $5,800 for each
approved student. In accordance with DoD FMR Volume 10, Chapter 12, Section
120323, “to minimize the need for reimbursing the employee, the preference is to
pay the training provider directly.” Even though the total price the Government
would otherwise be obligated to pay to reimburse all attendees directly is
$29,000, the CH may use their GPC for each of these payments because none
individually exceeds the $25,000 SF 182 payment threshold. When the Government
has recurring requirements for the same course the contracting office should be
consulted to determine if a contract-based solution should be used to ensure the
Government receives the best pricing. GPC SF 182 training payment authority may
only be used to pay vendors directly for training approved on an SF 182 that
would otherwise be directly reimbursed to an individual; the price of any one SF
182-based GPC transaction may not exceed $25,000.</p>
      <p class="p">2) <strong class="ph b">Situation 2.</strong> The requiring activity has a requirement to provide a
retirement training course; up to 30 individuals can attend. <em class="ph i">The training
will take place off the installation. </em> The estimated cost for the retirement
training is $11,000 for the course.</p>
      <p class="p"> 
         <strong class="ph b">Resolution</strong>: The activity is purchasing a course (group training),
which is considered a service and a FAR-based action. Taking the training off
the installation is not a relevant factor for considering if the GPC can be used
in this situation. This service is professional, and subject to the applicable
services MPT of $10,000. Since the total price is above the MPT, the request
must be submitted to the contracting office for action.</p>
      <p class="p">3) <strong class="ph b">Situation 3</strong>. The requiring activity is requesting a (regularly
scheduled, COTS, priced the same for everyone, no tailoring) existing leadership
training course for 15 students for a total cost of $6,000. <em class="ph i">The training will
take place at the installation</em>.</p>
      <p class="p"> 
         <strong class="ph b">Resolution</strong>: The activity is purchasing a course (group training),
which is considered a service and a FAR-based action. The SF 182 is not
applicable for this situation and cannot be used for this purchase requirement.
This service is professional; therefore, the purchase is subject to the
applicable services MPT of $10,000. A CH authorized to make micro-purchases on
the open market can make the purchase as long as it does not require agreement
to terms and conditions other than price and delivery. Open market
micro-purchases are limited to the MPT ($10,000 or when in direct support of an
Emergency-type Operation, one of the higher MPTs could apply). Alternatively, if
a fixed-price indefinite delivery contract does not require the CH to agree to
any terms and conditions, a CH with Ordering Official authority could make the
purchase.</p>
      <p class="p">4) <strong class="ph b">Situation 4.</strong> The requiring activity is requesting specialized
forklift training at a Government facility. A forklift operator from a local
sales and repair shop will be conducting the class. The quote includes a SOW and
an outline of agency-specific topics to cover. The estimated cost of the
training is $5,000.</p>
      <p class="p"> 
         <strong class="ph b">Resolution</strong>: The GPC cannot be used. The vendor is offering tailored
training, which is considered a service and a FAR-based action. The applicable
services MPT is $2,500, because the instructor is an OSHA-certified forklift
operator. This occupation falls under the services subject to 41 USC Chapter 67,
Service Contract Labor Standards. The request should be directed to the
contracting office.</p>
      <p class="p">5) <strong class="ph b">Situation 5</strong>. Three individuals each have an approved SF 182
authorizing them to attend leadership training. The cost of the training is
$2,000 per student (seat). <em class="ph i">The training is to be held virtually</em>. The
training is for attendance at a regularly scheduled, off-the-shelf course that
is available to the public and priced the same for everyone in the same category
(e.g., price per student) and requires no tailoring.</p>
      <p class="p"> 
         <strong class="ph b">Resolution</strong>: The training institution should invoice $2,000 for each
approved student. In accordance with DoD FMR Volume 10, Chapter 12, Section
120323, “to minimize the need for reimbursing the employee, the preference is to
pay the training provider directly.” The CH may use their training GPC for each
of these payments because none individually exceeds the $25,000 SF 182 payment
threshold. When the Government has recurring requirements for the same course
the contracting office should be consulted to determine if a contract-based
solution should be used to ensure the Government receives the best pricing.</p>

    <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">Commanders at all levels must ensure that the Government's interests are protected when an employee fails to complete training for which the Army pays all or part of the training expenses. This policy includes both Government and non-Government training.</p>
        <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">Government Training</strong>. If an employee fails to complete training satisfactorily, one of the following actions will take place:</p>

Employees must be advised in writing of these requirements before the training starts. If the failure to complete training is due to the employee's negligence or willful misconduct, the employee must repay training expenses other than salary costs. If appropriate, disciplinary action will be taken. If failure is for reasons beyond the employee's control, no action will be taken.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. <a class="xref" href="https://chess.army.mil/" target="_blank">CHESS</a> is the mandatory source for all purchases of
commercial-off-the-shelf software, desktops, notebook computers, video
teleconferencing equipment, and other commercial Information Technology (IT)
equipment (e.g., routers, servers, printers, peripherals, regardless of dollar
value). CHESS is the mandatory source for all Army IT purchases, except for the
Air National Guard, which is exempt from the CHESS requirement and must purchase
IT through <a class="xref" href="https://www.afadvantage.gov/" target="_blank">AFADVANTAGE/GSA-2GIT</a> to retain IT compatibility. Per
AFARS 5108.7403, before procuring commercial software outside of the CHESS
contracts, the contracting officer or contract ordering official CH must ensure
that the requiring activity obtains a waiver. Any IT hardware or software
purchase made outside of CHESS requires a Statement of Non-availability (SoNA).
See AFARS 5139.101-90(a) and AR 25-1.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. All desktops and notebooks must be purchased during one of the
Consolidated Buy ordering periods that occur three times annually (Oct/Jan,
Feb/May, and Jun/Sep). Consolidated Buy exception memos are prepared by the
requiring activity and are approved by an O6/GS-15 (or equivalent) within the
requiring activity and must remain a part of the transaction document file. An
exception memo example is available at <a class="xref" href="https://chess.army.mil/Content/Page/CB_EXPT" target="_blank">CHESS Exception Request</a>.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. IT hardware or software purchases require an Army Deputy Chief of Staff
(DCS), G-6 approved Information Technology Approval System (ITAS) Memorandum.
CHs must include the ITAS Approval Memorandum in the transaction file along with
all other supporting documentation. Supporting documentation must include
documentation submitted with the ITAS approval request such as a CHESS SoNA. The
CHESS website provides information concerning ITAS approvals. CHs may also
consult their local command for guidance. The ITAS Approval website is located
at <a class="xref" href="https://cprobe.army.mil/enterprise-portal/web/itas/home" target="_blank">https://cprobe.army.mil/enterprise-portal/web/itas/home</a>.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. Any IT hardware or software purchase made outside of CHESS requires a
SoNA. A SoNA is a notice that a particular product is not currently available
through a CHESS contract. It is not a waiver to purchase, nor does it authorize
use on the Army network. For detailed instructions on SoNA requirements and how
to obtain a SoNA, see <a class="xref" href="https://chess.army.mil/Content/Page/SONA" target="_blank">CHESS SONA</a>.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">9-7.</span> Supplemental Procurement Guidance</h3>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">Sustainable Procurement</strong>. Sustainable procurement is the purchase of
environmentally preferable products and services in accordance with
federally-mandated "green" procurement preference programs. The goal is to
achieve 100% compliance with mandatory Federal affirmative procurement programs
in all acquisition transactions. This policy applies to all acquisitions from
major systems programs to individual unit supply and service requisitions. For
more information on sustainable procurement, see FAR 23 or specific sustainable
policies located at <a class="xref" href="https://www.denix.osd.mil/spp/guidance/index.html" target="_blank">https://www.denix.osd.mil/spp/guidance/index.html</a>.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">FedMall</strong>. FedMall is a Government e-commerce acquisition platform
which may be used for procuring supplies beyond those listed in Section 8-1. CHs
who use FedMall are required to register for a FedMall account. To register, CHs
will need to know their Department of Defense Activity Address Code (DoDAAC) or
their Activity Address Code (AAC). If FedMall does not recognize the CH’s DoDAAC
or AAC, CHs should contact their A/OPC to request the contracting office’s
Procurement DoDAAC for registration. <a class="xref" href="https://www.dla.mil/Working-With-DLA/Applications/FedMall/" target="_blank">FedMall</a> is accessible through the CH’s PIEE account via
the FedMall icon.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">General Services Administration (GSA) Programs</strong>. GSA maintains the
Federal Supply Schedule program, also known as the GSA Schedules Program or the
Multiple Award Schedule Program. GSA offers an online shopping service called <a class="xref" href="https://www.gsaadvantage.gov/" target="_blank">GSA Advantage!</a> through which CHs may place orders
against Schedules. CHs may also use GSA Advantage! to place orders through <a class="xref" href="https://www.gsaglobalsupply.gsa.gov/" target="_blank">GSA’s Global Supply System</a>, a GSA wholesale supply
source, formerly known as "GSA Stock" or the "Customer Supply Center."</p>
      <p class="p">1) GSA Advantage! enables CHs to search specific information (e.g., national
stock number, part number, common name), review delivery options, place orders
directly with Schedule contractors, and pay for orders using the GPC.</p>
      <p class="p">2) CHs may place orders up to the MPT with any FSS contractor that can meet
the agency’s needs. Although not required to solicit from a specific number of
schedule contractors, ordering activities should attempt to distribute orders
among contractors.</p>
      <p class="p">3) Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI) agreements are accessible at <a class="xref" href="http://www.gsa.gov/fssi" target="_blank">FSSI</a>. Cardholders should consider FSSI before using
commercial sources.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. Specific guidance on the use of required sources and order of precedence
of sources is prescribed in FAR Part 8 and DFARS Part 208. In addition to
mandatory sources, CHs should strongly consider purchasing from small businesses
and small disadvantaged businesses whenever possible.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Commercial Sources</strong>. Before purchasing from a commercial source, CHs
must review applicable mandatory sources (see Table 9-1) and non-mandatory
Government sources (e.g., FedMall and GSA). CHs should rotate commercial
sources. CHs may purchase from a commercial source if the requested supplies or
services are unavailable from the applicable mandatory source. Price is an
unacceptable reason to avoid a mandatory source. CHs may choose a commercial
source over a non-mandatory Government source, if the commercial quote is more
favorable due to minimum order quantity, delivery time, price, etc. When buying
from a commercial source, CHs should include a justification in the purchase
request form or file documentation explaining why they chose a non-Government
source.</p>

   <h3 class="title topictitle3" id="ariaid-title95">
      <span class="ph autonumber">9-8.</span> E-Commerce Platforms</h3>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. An e-marketplace platform is an online platform where CHs can evaluate and
order products via a portal operated by a vendor: the portal provider. The
e-marketplace platforms can offer portal provider products and/or third-party
vendor products. Portal providers and third-party vendors are generally
responsible for fulfilling orders for their respective products.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. GSA’s Commercial Platforms program (also known as GSA’s e-commerce
platforms) provides a managed channel for open-market purchases through select
commercial online platforms (this currently includes AmazonBusiness.com,
FisherSci.com, and OverstockGovernment.com). As this program is a relatively new
initiative, DPC approval is required in advance of Component participation.
Components making or seeking to make purchases using all other non-DoD
e-commerce platforms are required to notify the Agency Program Management Office
in writing and provide implementation information as requested.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. Third-party payment processor policy does not apply to e-commerce
platforms or brick-and-mortar merchants that do not accept payment using
third-party payment processors. In the e-commerce space, this includes, at a
minimum, those in GSA’s Commercial Platforms program, and AmazonBusiness.com
(separate and distinct from AmazonBusiness.com participating in GSA’s Commercial
Platforms program). However, as such platforms could change their payment
practices and begin allowing use of third-party payment processors, CPMs are
responsible for issuing Component-level policy that:</p>
      <p class="p">1) Establishes and implements procedures for validating that each applicable
e-commerce platform continues to disallow use of third-party payment processors.
Procedures shall include a certain periodicity for re-validating following
initial validation, for each applicable e-commerce platform. This re-validation
shall occur at least semi-annually.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Ensures that following completion of each validation and re-validation,
GPC oversight personnel and CHs are notified regarding whether or not the
applicable e-commerce platform does not/continues not to accept payment using
third party payment processors to meet this criterion for non-applicability of
third-party payment policy.</p>
      <p class="p">3) Mandates that upon notification that an e-commerce platform has begun
accepting payment using third party payment processors, CHs begin complying with
DoD and Component third-party payment policy, for the applicable platform.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">E-Marketplace Platform Method of Payment</strong>. The GPC is the only
authorized method of payment for purchases placed on the e-marketplace
platforms. CHs are not allowed to use any other forms of payment, including
third-party payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Venmo, Google Wallet, WePay, etc)
or payments using any form of cryptocurrency. The GPC will be the only allowable
method of payment, and all GPCs must be used by an authorized CH. The
e-marketplace model encourages robust competition not only at the platform level
by offering millions of products across thousands of suppliers, but also at the
product level, with multiple suppliers competing to sell a given product.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Compliance with AbilityOne</strong>. Mandatory sources such as AbilityOne
are effectively represented and promoted in this program. Rather than simply
state that e-marketplaces are required to “block and sub” the commercial item
for the AbilityOne item, GSA requires platform providers to prevent the sale of
a commercial item which is “essentially the same” as an item on the AbilityOne
Procurement List. In addition, GSA requires platform providers to ensure the
vendors selling AbilityOne products are, in fact, authorized distributors.</p>
      <p class="p List1">f. <strong class="ph b">Data Visibility</strong>. Identifying leakage through the commercial
platforms will allow the Army the ability to identify purchases that could be
going to AbilityOne distributors, small business suppliers, excluded entities,
or spend outside of strategic or mandatory-use agency contracts. This data then
allows the Army to take the necessary action in an effort to appropriately
manage this spend. Spend data will be available to the Army through on-demand
reports and dashboards, allowing the Army to see line-level spend from all
e-marketplace platforms. CHs will also have real-time, account level access to
their purchasing data through the e-marketplace platforms for purchase card
reconciliation and spend analysis.</p>
      <p class="p List1">g. <strong class="ph b">Supply Chain Security</strong>. To address vulnerabilities within the global
supply chain, GSA is implementing several solutions to create additional
visibility and reduce concerns related to supply chain security. The approach is
two-fold and addresses removal of both prohibited vendors and prohibited
products. GSA’s approach includes the following:</p>
      <p class="p">1) Section 1634, which limits or prohibits the purchase of certain items,
based on statutory requirements that apply to all Federal purchases, including
purchases from Kaspersky Lab.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Curating or filtering what Federal buyers can purchase, by allowing
agencies to prohibit categories of items from purchase, where necessary.</p>
      <p class="p">3) Recommending best practices for e-commerce platforms and third-party
marketplaces, as described in the DHS report, Combating Trafficking in
Counterfeit and Pirated Goods, from January 24, 2020.</p>
      <p class="p">4) Leveraging the commercial Supply Chain Risk Management practices that
e-marketplace platforms already possess around counterfeit and supply chain
concerns, to include data associated with country of origin and detailed product
descriptions, as well as quality control practices and supplier performance.</p>
      <p class="p">5) Reviewing spend data post-purchase to identify any suspect purchases that
might have slipped through the cracks and warrant further review.</p>
      <p class="p">6) Section 889 on the prohibition on procurement of certain telecommunication
and video surveillance equipment applies to the commercial e-commerce program as
it does to every other Federal contract.</p>
      <p class="p">7) CHs may consider a product’s Country of Origin when made available on the
e-marketplace platforms as a part of their buying criteria.</p>

        <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title96">Chapter 10 - Convenience Checks and Foreign Draft Checks</h2>
        <div class="body"></div>
<article class="topic concept nested2" aria-labelledby="ariaid-title97" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_10-1">
   <h3 class="title topictitle3" id="ariaid-title97">
      <span class="ph autonumber">10-1.</span> Policy and Use</h3>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. Convenience checks provide activities with the flexibility to issue checks
for payment of supplies and services to support mission needs when the vendor
doesn’t accept payment by GPC. Convenience checks may be used for purchases when
supplies or service are available for delivery or completion within 15 days,
whether at the contractor’s place of business or at destination.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. DoD policy has a goal to decrease convenience check usage on an annual
basis. The Army does not receive rebates or retain dispute rights on convenience
check purchases. The authority to maintain a convenience check account will be
justified on an individual organization basis and controlled and monitored by
the organization’s CCO. The number of convenience check accounts per
installation must be kept to a minimum. Convenience check accounts are available
only to organizations that maintain active GPC accounts in good standing.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. Convenience checks should only be used when the vendor does not accept the
GPC. Convenience checks may not be used to avoid the normal GPC payment process.
Before a check is issued, the paying agency must make every effort to use the
GPC, including making maximum efforts to find and use merchants that accept the
GPC.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Restrictions</strong>.</p>
      <p class="p">1) Checkwriters must not use checks for employee reimbursements, cash
advances, cash awards, travel-related transportation payments, or meals.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Convenience check purchases must not require detailed specifications or an
inspection report.</p>
      <p class="p">3) Convenience checks should not be used for recurring payments.</p>
      <p class="p">4) Convenience checks must not be used as a method of payment against
existing contract instruments.</p>
      <p class="p">5) Checks will not be issued as an “exchange-for-cash” vehicle to establish
cash funds. If merchants issue credits or refunds by cash or check, the funds
must be immediately credited to the account against which the purchase was
originally made.</p>
      <p class="p">6) The same purchase prohibitions that apply to the GPC apply to convenience
checks.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Micro-purchase Threshold</strong>. The MPTs for convenience checks are half
of the open market and contingency MPTs. See Table 1-2. Splitting payments
across multiple checks is prohibited if the total requirement will exceed the
applicable convenience check MPT. Checkwriters may use checks for purchases in
support of declared contingency events up to the applicable convenience check
MPT.</p>
      <p class="p List1">f. <strong class="ph b">Processing Fee</strong>. Convenience checks should be written for the exact
payment amount. The payment amount for a check does not include the servicing
bank’s administrative processing fee. The check processing fee is added by the
servicing bank during processing of the transaction, and the addition of the
processing fee is not considered a split requirement. Checkwriters should ensure
that the total funds obligated include both the payment amount and the
processing fee. The convenience check MPT is for the payment amount of the good
or service, which does not include the processing fee (e.g., a check may be
written up to $5,000; the processing fee is accounted for separately and is
charged separately on the billing statement).</p>
      <p class="p List1">g. <strong class="ph b">Security and Oversight</strong>. Convenience checks are negotiable
instruments and must be stored in a locked container, such as a safe or locking
filing cabinet. Checks must be accounted for appropriately to prevent loss,
theft, or potential forgery. Convenience check accounts must be reviewed
annually by a disinterested party and not the A/OPC.</p>
      <p class="p List1">h. Convenience checks are pre-numbered, and their use is controlled with a
separate convenience check purchase log for each account. Check purchases are
reconciled just as other GPC transactions, as a part of the monthly statement
billing cycle in the servicing bank’s EAS. Checkwriters must retain copies of
voided checks through the carbon copy or photocopy the original check as a part
of their file documentation.</p>
      <p class="p List1">i. <strong class="ph b">Disputes</strong>. The normal GPC dispute process is not applicable to
convenience checks. Concerns over a check purchase must be resolved directly
with the merchant. The checkwriter is responsible for securing credits or
resolving problems with the merchant. Each organization is responsible for all
checks written on an account, unless it is determined fraud is involved. In some
cases, payments can be stopped on a convenience check that has been written if
the check has not yet been posted to an account. To stop payment on a check, the
checkwriter must call the servicing bank’s customer service department to
receive instructions on processing the action.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">10-2.</span> Establishing a Convenience Check Account</h3>
  <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. Convenience check accounts are dedicated accounts and must be maintained separately from the GPC account. Cardholders may have both a regular GPC account and a separate convenience check account. Checkwriters must ensure that payee information on the convenience check is <strong class="ph b">written legibly</strong>. Convenience checks are not to be used for recurring payments.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. Any U.S. Government employee, military or civilian, including local national employees, may be selected for appointment as a checkwriter. Traditional part-time National Guard members cannot be checkwriters. Contractors working for the Army cannot be checkwriters.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. Requests to establish convenience check accounts must be justified in writing by the organization and forwarded to the Level 4 A/OPC. Required information must consist of the following:</p>
      <p class="p">1) Reason for requesting checks</p>
      <p class="p">2) Types of vendors to which the checks would be written</p>
      <p class="p">3) Estimated dollar amount of checks intended to be written within a 12-month period</p>
      <p class="p">4) Single and monthly purchase limits</p>
      <p class="p">5) Checkwriter’s complete name, office name, address, email, phone/fax number</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. Checkwriters must be appointed in PIEE/JAM with the “Micro-Purchase Convenience Check Writer” designation. The checkwriter is the only person who has the authority to issue and sign checks.</p>

   <h3 class="title topictitle3" id="ariaid-title99">
      <span class="ph autonumber">10-3.</span> Convenience Check Reporting (IRS Form 1099)</h3>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. IRS requires DoD federal agencies to report convenience check payments as
income. See 26 USC 6041, 6041A, and 6045. IRS Form 1099 must be issued to check
recipients for certain payment types. (Refer to <a class="xref" href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1099msc.pdf" target="_blank">IRS Instructions for Form 1099 - MISC</a> for more detail
regarding payment types that are not reportable to DFAS.) Convenience check data
must be reported to the IRS as income to the check recipients. IRS matches the
reported data to the check recipients’ tax returns to ensure income is
reported.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Tax Reporting</strong>. The DFAS Tax Office emails convenience check
purchasing data to the checkwriters for verification on a monthly basis. The
email contains a spreadsheet, instructions, and the suspense date for return.
Upon receipt of the spreadsheet, checkwriters must update the required columns
and email the spreadsheet to the following mailbox: <a class="xref" href="mailto:dfas.cco-checks@mail.mil" target="_blank">DFAS 1099 Check Writer Reporting</a> within five business
days upon receipt. This data is used to process IRS 1099-MISC forms. The BO is
responsible to monitor the checkwriter's compliance. BOs and checkwriters who do
not return the requested information to DFAS are responsible for their own tax
form issuance and IRS tax reporting. Instructions for submitting convenience
check 1099 tax reporting information is available on the <a class="xref" href="https://www.dfas.mil/contractorsvendors/taxinfo/Convenience-Check-1099PRO/" target="_blank">DFAS Office Website</a>.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. Checkwriters will obtain the vendor information and W-9 required for tax
reporting before paying the vendor, as stated in DoD 7000-14R FMR 26 Volume 10,
Chapter 6, 060209. The checkwriter is responsible for tax reporting for the
convenience checks they issue and for obtaining a signed IRS Form W9, Request
for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. DFAS ESS Tax Office will perform the following actions:</p>
      <p class="p">1) Provide monthly spreadsheets containing the servicing bank’s universe of
convenience check payment data to A/OPCs, BOs, and checkwriters for completion
of additional information.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Provide tax reporting guidance to checkwriters.</p>
      <p class="p">3) Aggregate the payment data to determine tax form issuance and issue tax
forms to check recipients.</p>
      <p class="p">4) Electronically report the payment data to the IRS.</p>
      <p class="p">5) Provide report to A/OPCs, BOs, and checkwriters of data that resulted in
tax form issuance.</p>
      <p class="p">6) Provide customer service to tax form recipients.</p>
      <p class="p">7) Issue corrected tax forms.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. A/OPCs, Billing Officials, and Checkwriters will perform the following
actions:</p>
      <p class="p">1) Supplement the payment data with the necessary reporting data, annotate
payment as reportable or not reportable, and return spreadsheets to tax
office.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Maintain and update points of contact in the U.S. Bank account.</p>
      <p class="p">3) Maintain final summarized spreadsheet provided by DFAS and copies of the
check registers for audit purposes.</p>
      <p class="p">4) Have a signed W-9 from vendors on file.</p>
      <p class="p">5) Ensure that spreadsheets are completed correctly and returned by
deadline.</p>
      <p class="p List1">f. The checkwriter must complete the following fields in the DFAS
spreadsheet:</p>
      <p class="p">1) <strong class="ph b">Payment Description</strong>. Define the purpose of the payment to the
vendor.</p>
      <p class="p">2) <strong class="ph b">Yes or No Reportable Transaction</strong>. Indicate whether vendor and
payment type are tax reportable. “Yes” is reportable. “No” is not
reportable.</p>
      <p class="p">3) For all tax reportable payments, complete the following fields:</p>
      <p class="p">(a) Vendor’s Taxpayer Identification Number: SSN, EIN, ITIN</p>
      <p class="p">(b) Vendor’s Name and Doing Business As Name</p>
      <p class="p">(c) Vendor’s Current mailing address</p>
      <p class="p">(d) Vendor’s City</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">10-4.</span> Before Writing a Convenience Check</h3>
  <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">IRS Form W-9.</strong> Before writing a convenience check, the checkwriter must always obtain an IRS Form W-9 to ensure possession of all information required for tax form issuance.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. DFAS recommends not writing checks to foreign vendors. When writing a check to a foreign vendor, an IRS Form W-8 is required before payment. To determine which W-8 form is used, see IRS Publication 515, Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Entities. To determine if tax withholding and tax deposits to the IRS are required, see IRS Publication 515, Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Entities and/or IRS Publication 901, U.S. Tax Treaties.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. If a U.S. vendor refuses to provide their TIN and it is a tax reportable payment, IRS states to backup withhold 24% and deposit with IRS. See IRS Publication 1281, Backup Withholding for Missing and Incorrect Name/TIN(s).</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. Consider alternative payment methods. See the <a class="xref" href="https://smartpay.gsa.gov/sites/default/files/downloads/SP%20Convenience%20Checks%20Slipsheet%20508.pdf" target="_blank">GSA Payment Solutions Brochure</a> for alternatives to using convenience checks. A good alternative to the convenience check process is using the miscellaneous payment process or using a vendor that accepts the GPC.</p>

  <h3 class="title topictitle3" id="ariaid-title101">
      <span class="ph autonumber">10-5.</span> Why Decrease Use of Convenience Checks?</h3>
  <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">No Refunds</strong>. Check transactions do not receive refunds otherwise
      provided on by use of the GPC.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Minimized fraud</strong>. Checks often do not require signature
      verification, which could lead to fraudulent transactions. In addition,
      they do not carry the same “paper trail” as other electronic payment
      methods, which may lead to misuse.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Streamlined processes</strong>. Electronic payments, like the GPC, help
      facilitate smoother transactions, enhance transparency, save time, and
      lead to improved data monitoring capabilities.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Green initiatives</strong>. Electronic payments help reduce paper usage
      and aid agencies in meeting their sustainability goals. Records also
      reside in a central location which will make it easier to locate and
      verify information.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Increased consumer protection</strong>. The GPC provides the opportunity
      for a much quicker reimbursement to a customer who may be unsatisfied with
      a product or service or who is charged incorrectly.</p>
      <p class="p List1">f. <strong class="ph b">Less hassle</strong>. Check transactions must be reported to the IRS
      using a 1099 form. Alternatively, in accordance with Section 6050W of the
      Housing Assistance Tax Act (Public Law 110-289), agencies are no longer
      required to report charge card transactions to the IRS using the 1099
      form.</p>
      <p class="p List1">g. <strong class="ph b">Time and Cost Savings</strong>. Utilizing a GPC instead of a convenience
      check delivers tremendous time and cost savings, leaving more time for
      mission-critical activities.</p>
      <p class="p List1">h. <strong class="ph b">Improved merchant-client relationship</strong>. When a GPC is used,
      merchants are paid within three days of the transaction. They receive a
      guaranteed payment and as a result, are able to provide greater security,
      reports, and data to the customer. This increases satisfaction on both
      sides of the transaction.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">11-1.</span> Management Oversight Controls</h3>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. DoD Instruction 5010.40, “Managers’ Internal Control Program Procedures,”
30 May 2013, requires DoD organizations to implement a comprehensive system of
internal controls providing reasonable assurance that programs are operating as
intended and to evaluate the effectiveness of the controls. Management and
program oversight is conducted to achieve the following goals:</p>
      <p class="p">1) Validate and promote compliance with existing purchasing and management
internal controls.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Identify, report, and resolve systemic material program weaknesses.</p>
      <p class="p">3) Measure the effectiveness of purchasing and management internal
controls.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. GPC management oversight controls are tools and activities that are used
to identify, report, and address fraud, waste, and abuse. The Army GPC Program
fully implements guidance and direction addressed in the April 18, 2019, OUSD
Memorandum, “DoD SmartPay® 3 Government-wide Commercial Purchase Card policies,
Procedures and Tools – SP3 Transition Memorandum #6.”</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Data analytics.</strong> Data analytics is the application of electronic
tools (software and/or systems) for automated data sorting, filtering and mining
techniques using self-learning algorithms to search GPC transaction data in
order to identify patterns, trends, risks, opportunities and other information.
Data analytics and reporting tools are available as part of the GSA SmartPay® 3
Government-wide charge card program. Agencies have the ability to monitor their
account transactions to identify any unusual spending patterns or frequency of
transactions. Agency data analytics, in addition to the data analytics
techniques already used by the banks to monitor account transactions, provide a
multi-layered approach to help identify suspected fraud, misuse and delinquency.
Data analytics can also be used to identify opportunities for expanded card use
and associated benefits for the Army. A/OPCs should use data analytics tools to
assist them in the management and oversight of their GPC program.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. The Army uses preventive, detective, and directive controls to monitor the
GPC program.</p>
      <p class="p">1) Preventive controls are designed to discourage errors or irregularities
from occurring (e.g., processing a transaction only after it has been properly
approved by the appropriate personnel).</p>
      <p class="p">2) Detective controls are designed to find errors or irregularities after
they have occurred (e.g., IOD data mining, approving statements, and reconciling
monthly invoices).</p>
      <p class="p">3) Directive controls are designed to encourage a desirable event (e.g.,
written policies and procedures to assist in compliance and the accomplishment
of the goals and objectives of the GPC program).</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. Understanding internal controls
assists GPC participants in their stewardship role in achieving GPC program
objectives. Internal control is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the achievement of objectives in the following categories:
effectiveness and efficiency of operations, reliability of financial reporting,
and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. This
understanding provides an additional
reference tool for all GPC participants to identify and assess operating
controls, financial reporting, and legal/regulatory compliance processes and to
take action to strengthen controls where needed. Over time, controls may be
expected to change to reflect changes in the operating environment. In order to
achieve a balance between risk and controls, internal
controls should address exposure to risk and be proactive, value-added, and
cost-effective.</p>
      <p class="p List1">f. Identifying Fraudulent, Improper and Abusive Purchases. Designing and
conducting procedures specifically for the purpose of detecting such
transactions (e.g., IOD data mining) serves multiple purposes, including the
potential discovery of a previously unrecognized risk in the program. Repeated
non-adherence to established internal control policies and procedures, such as
inadequate documentation of purchase card transactions or supervisory reviews,
if allowed to continue, would contribute to erosion and weakening of the GPC
internal control system. Prompt administrative and disciplinary actions can be
effective in reducing persistent lack of adherence to policies and procedures by
CHs and other program officials.</p>
      <p class="p List1">g. The SCO and A/OPCs are responsible for adhering to the requirements
specified in OMB Circular A-123, Management’s Responsibility for Internal
Control. This circular provides guidance on improving the accountability and
effectiveness of GPC programs and operations by establishing, assessing,
correcting, and reporting on internal control, as well as prescribing policies
and procedures to agencies regarding how to maintain internal controls that
reduce the risk of fraud, waste, and error in GPC programs.</p>
      <p class="p List1">h. The SCO and A/OPCs are also responsible for adhering to the requirements
specified in 10 USC 4754 (as modified by Public Law 112–194, Government Charge
Card Abuse Prevention Act of 2012). These statutory requirements mandate the
following actions (list not comprehensive):</p>
      <p class="p">1) Using effective systems, techniques, and technologies to prevent or
identify improper purchases.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Invalidating GPCs from each employee who ceases to be employed by the
Government or separates from Military Service.</p>
      <p class="p">3) Taking steps to recover the cost of any illegal, improper, or erroneous
purchases made with a purchase card or convenience check made by an employee or
member of the armed forces, including, as necessary, through salary offsets.</p>
      <p class="p">4) Taking appropriate adverse personnel actions or imposing other punishments
when employees of the Army violate regulations governing the use and control of
purchase cards and convenience checks or who are negligent or engage in misuse,
abuse, or fraud with respect to a purchase card, including removal in
appropriate cases. Violations of such regulations by a person subject to 10 USC
Chapter 47, the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), is punishable as a
violation of section 892 of article 92 of the UCMJ.</p>
      <p class="p">5) Requiring the Army Audit Agency to conduct periodic audits or reviews of
GPC programs to identify and analyze risks of illegal, improper, or erroneous
purchases and payments and report the result to the Director of the OMB and
Congress.</p>
      <p class="p List1">i. A/OPCs must provide monitoring, oversight, training, and administration of
all BOs and CHs. Supervisors and BOs are responsible for the monitoring and
oversight of BOs and CHs under their purview.</p>
      <p class="p List1">j. To minimize losses to the Army, the program must have an expectation of
high integrity and ethical behavior from all participants, and sufficient staff
to perform the following functions:</p>
      <p class="p">1) Conduct periodic risk assessments to identify fraud, waste, and abuse and
establish specific controls to reasonably ensure that losses from these risks
are minimized, to include data mining.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Conduct proper training and complete reporting and data analysis to ensure
personnel have the skills and information needed to be effective in their
positions.</p>
      <p class="p">3) Conduct detailed, effective management and oversight.</p>
      <p class="p">4) Implement corrective actions when cardholder management is non-compliant
with Army policies and procedures.</p>
      <p class="p List1">k. Monitoring and oversight of the GPC is a shared responsibility. All
stakeholders in the program, including Resource and Financial Managers,
logistics, contracting, and local audit and oversight organizations, are
responsible for ensuring that the GPC is used in the proper manner and only
authorized and necessary official purchases are made. Organizations should
develop and follow a monitoring and oversight plan that establishes frequencies,
methods, participation, etc., on how their monitoring/oversight programs will
operate.</p>
      <p class="p List1">l. DPC issued several SP3 Transition Memorandums on GPC monitoring and
oversight. DPC will rely on the signed Semi-Annual HA data provided by CPMs to
accomplish DoD GPC reporting required by OMB. DPC updates visual trending of
statistical and violation information to identify trends in GPC use and
variances and shares this information with the Army during the GPC CPM Monthly
Calls.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_11-1__Hlk118374461">m. The GPC Integrated Solutions Team (IST) is DoD’s GPC
governance body. IST membership consists of a GPC Governance Board composed of
representatives from DPC, Army, Navy, Air Force, other Defense agencies, and
supported by the bank team. The bank team consists of U.S. Bank (card-issuing
bank), MasterCard (card association), and Oversight Systems (data mining
vendor). The IST typically meets semi-annually to achieve the following:</p>
      <p class="p">1) Review trends and changes in the GPC industry and the DoD GPC Program.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Identify and approve any necessary adjustments to the bank team's
electronic capabilities, DoD’s GPC enterprise tools, and/or DoD GPC
policies.</p>
      <p class="p">3) Identify and approve changes to the DM rules and system parameter
settings.</p>
      <p class="p">4) Bring efficiencies to the Program by adjusting the business
rules/parameters based on transaction risk.</p>
      <p class="p">5) Review trends and changes in the GPC industry and the DoD GPC Program.</p>
      <p class="p">6) Identify any necessary adjustments to the bank team's electronic
capabilities, DoD’s GPC enterprise tools, and/or DoD GPC policies.</p>
      <p class="p">7) Identify and approving changes to the Data Mining rules.</p>
      <p class="p">8) Review relevant data mining case information and recommendations provided
by the bank team (e.g., percentage of data mining cases created for review;
frequency with which each rule is triggered and associated DM case disposition,
and information about the findings, determinations, and corrective actions
identified) and results of the Semi-Annual HA process to inform its decision
making.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">11-2.</span> Internal Management Controls</h3>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. Management officials are responsible for establishing a system of internal
controls that provides reasonable assurance that the GPC program is efficiently,
effectively, and legally achieving its purpose and complies with applicable laws
and regulations.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. Required internal management controls include the following:</p>
      <p class="p">1) <strong class="ph b">Management Controls</strong>. GPC programs will evaluate the expected
benefits and related costs of internal control activities.</p>
      <p class="p">2) <strong class="ph b">Training</strong>. All GPC program participants will receive appropriate
role-based training.</p>
      <p class="p">3) <strong class="ph b">Delegation of Authority</strong>. GPC programs will clearly document
Delegations of Procurement Authority beginning with a DFARS-designated
Contracting Activity (DFARS PGI 202.101) down to each CH. Each program
participant will receive and sign the delegation and appointment documents
(e.g., Delegation of Procurement Authority letters, appointment letters, and DD
Form 577) required for their role.</p>
      <p class="p">4) <strong class="ph b">System Functional Responsibility Controls</strong>. Electronic systems used
to support the DoD GPC program will segregate role-based capabilities and limit
access to functions to only individuals with appropriate authority. The system
will be able to identify who made any data/file content changes in the
end-to-end GPC process.</p>
      <p class="p">5) <strong class="ph b">System Access Security</strong>. Appropriate safeguards will be in place to
control issuance of user IDs and access credentials to the EAS.</p>
      <p class="p">6) <strong class="ph b">CH Account Initiation</strong>. Only personnel in the CH's supervisory chain
are authorized to request the opening of a new CH account. This request must
identify appropriate card parameters.</p>
      <p class="p">7) <strong class="ph b">Authorization Controls</strong>. Appropriate spending limits, budget (i.e.,
credit) limits, and MCC access will be established and tailored to each CH
account. Spending limits and MCC access should reflect historical buying
patterns/ trends.</p>
      <p class="p">8) <strong class="ph b">Purchase Log</strong>. All CHs maintain a purchase log on the servicing
bank’s EAS unless a waiver is granted and signed by Army. If a waiver is
granted, CHs will document purchase information for each GPC transaction in an
electronic log in the automated system where the individual card transactions
and billing statements are approved and certified for payment.</p>
      <p class="p">9) <strong class="ph b">Maintain Positive System of Funds Control</strong>. Spending limits (such as
single purchase and credit limits) are tied directly to the funding allocated
for each card account (monthly, quarterly, and semiannually). Limits should be
consistent with historical spending patterns to minimize Government exposure and
ensure adequate funds availability. This control helps ensure that funding is
available prior to purchases being made with the GPC.</p>
      <p class="p">10) <strong class="ph b">Ensure Separation of Duties</strong>. Key duties must be assigned to
different individuals to the greatest extent possible to minimize the risk of
loss to the Government. Examples of key duties include making purchases (CH),
authorizing payments (BO), certifying funding (Resource Managers), and reviewing
and auditing purchase activity (A/OPC).</p>
      <p class="p">11) <strong class="ph b">Span of Control</strong>. To ensure GPC program participants have
sufficient time to complete required reviews, GPC programs will abide by
established span of control limits.</p>
      <p class="p">12) <strong class="ph b">Reconcile and Approve the CH Statement</strong>. During each billing cycle,
CHs are required to match orders and reconcile the statement they receive from
the issuing bank against the purchase card log in the bank’s EAS.</p>
      <p class="p">13) <strong class="ph b">Reconcile and Certify the Managing Account Statement</strong>. After the CH
has approved the statement, the BO must approve or reject each purchase made by
CHs in the BO’s managing account. When the BO has reviewed each invoice, the BO,
acting in the role of Certifying Officer, certifies the entire invoice as legal,
proper, and correct. A/OPCs must track managing account certification after the
end of the billing cycle.</p>
      <p class="p">14) <strong class="ph b">Exercise Dispute Authority</strong>. Cardholders have 90 days from the date
the transaction posted to the account to dispute the transaction, when
needed.</p>
      <p class="p">15) <strong class="ph b">Maintain Authorization Controls</strong>. A/OPCs must add the appropriate
MCC filters to each CH account.</p>
      <p class="p">16) <strong class="ph b">Ensure Systems Access Security</strong>. Appropriate safeguards must be in
place to control issuance and safeguarding of access credentials to the EAS.</p>
      <p class="p">17) <strong class="ph b">Ensure Available Funding Integrity</strong>. Certified LOAs must be
traceable through disbursement. All changes to LOAs must be documented and
certified.</p>
      <p class="p">18) <strong class="ph b">Ensure Invoice Integrity</strong>. An electronic certification process
ensures the original electronic invoice is traceable from the vendor through the
certification and entitlement processes and retained in a Government record.
Should the original invoice submitted by the contractor be in paper form, the
Certifying Officer will determine if the invoice is proper for payment and affix
his/her signature in accordance with the governing provisions of the DoD FMR. If
appropriate, the Certifying Officer makes any required “pen and ink” changes on
the original invoice to reallocate the payment to different funding lines from
those reflected on the original invoice. The Certifying Officer determines
whether these changes are proper and affix his/her signature with the standard
certification language on the original paper invoice.</p>
      <p class="p">19) <strong class="ph b">System Administration Integrity/Data Exchange/Transaction
Security</strong>. Changes to the operating system environment will be documented in
accordance with the DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation
(DIACAP) process.</p>
      <p class="p">20) <strong class="ph b">Transaction Data Integrity</strong>. The original transaction/invoice will
be maintained and cannot be altered.</p>
      <p class="p">21) <strong class="ph b">Data Mining</strong>. Implement a data mining capability that reviews all
GPC transactions.</p>
      <p class="p">22) <strong class="ph b">Inactive and Purged Accounts</strong>. A/OPCs must perform an annual review
of the ongoing need for existing card accounts. A/OPCs should terminate accounts
with no activity for more than six months or document the need for the account
to remain open. The servicing bank purges inactive accounts monthly, depending
on the status of the account.</p>
      <p class="p">23) <strong class="ph b">Terminated, Voluntarily Closed, and Fraud Referral status</strong>.
Servicing bank purges the account after 13 months of inactivity.</p>
      <p class="p">24) <strong class="ph b">Open status</strong>. Servicing bank purges the account after 21 months of
inactivity.</p>

            IOD DM capability evaluates each transaction against a set of tiered
            business rules to identify high-risk transactions. Tier 1 rules are
            mandatory and applicable to all DoD purchase cards. Tier 2 rules are
            mandatory rules that can be tailored as necessary at the local
            level. DM cases can be system-generated or manually generated. The
            system generates a DM case whenever a business rule is broken. GPC
            program officials are required to manually create cases for each
            finding and disciplinary category determination they independently

            in Insights on Demand (IOD)” on the DPC GPC website. To properly
            manage program risk for these potentially high-risk transactions,
            IOD automatically selects a random sample of 1% of these Tier 2
            “auto closed” cases and assigns them for adjudication (“1% Random
            Reopen”). The IST reviews Tier 2 Tailoring data sets and trends and
            considers methodology changes based on its findings.</p>

        <p class="p" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_11-4__Toc101163570">2) The BO reviews the CH’s file documentation in
            the bank’s EAS. The BO then locates the case in IOD and inputs
            requested data. </p>
        <p class="p">3) Once the BO has submitted their review, IOD assigns the case to
            the Level 4 A/OPC. The Level 4 A/OPC reviews the CH’s file
            documentation, inputs detailed comments regarding the purchase,
            identifies the applicable finding, and closes the case in IOD. The
            comments should provide information regarding the transaction and a
            detailed explanation of any findings. For administrative findings,
            the comments must state what documents or signatures were

  <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p">Fraud can be defined as a deception deliberately practiced with the motive of securing unfair or unlawful gain. Fraud can be an attempt to cheat the Federal Government and corrupt its CHs by using GPC accounts for transactions not part of official Government business. Fraud can come in many disguises, such as false emails, mail, or phone calls. The following are the three primary categories of fraud:</p>
      <p class="p">1) <strong class="ph b">Non-cardholder Fraud</strong>. Examples: Lost or stolen card, account takeover, and identity theft.</p>
      <p class="p">2) <strong class="ph b">Cardholder Fraud</strong>. Examples: Kickbacks, falsified transactions, and false statements.</p>
      <p class="p">3) <strong class="ph b">Merchant Fraud</strong>. Examples: False transactions, intentional mischarges, bribes, and gratuities.</p>

   <h3 class="title topictitle3" id="ariaid-title114">
      <span class="ph autonumber">11-8.</span> Non-Cardholder Fraud</h3>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. Non-cardholder fraud involves the use of the card account or CH data by an
unauthorized person. Non-cardholder fraud is investigated by special units
within the servicing bank. Any information acquired relating to non-cardholder
fraud should be reported. The risk of non-cardholder fraud is higher in certain
situations including the following:</p>
      <p class="p">1) <strong class="ph b">Account/Card never received</strong>. A new or replacement card has been
mailed to the account holder but was not received. This may be due to a
third-party interception. In this case, the account should be cancelled, and new
card issued.</p>
      <p class="p">2) <strong class="ph b">Lost or Stolen Account/Card</strong>. If the account holder reports the
account as lost or stolen, the account will be cancelled and new one issued.
Reporting the account as lost or stolen does not relieve the Federal Government
for payment for any transactions that were made by the account holder prior to
losing it. If transactions not made by the account holder appear on the
statement, the account holder has 90 days from the date of the transaction to
file a dispute. If it is not done within 90 days, they may forfeit their rights
to dispute.</p>
      <p class="p">3) <strong class="ph b">Altered or counterfeit cards</strong>. This occurs when third parties obtain
account information and used that information to make purchases with an altered
or counterfeit card. If the banks recognize a fraudulent pattern of use at the
time of authorization, the bank will validate the use of the account with the
account holder and/or suspend the account. If transactions not made by the
account holder appear on the statement, the account holder has 90 days from the
date of the transaction to file a dispute. If it is not done within 90 days,
they may forfeit their rights to dispute.</p>
      <p class="p">4) <strong class="ph b">Account takeover/ Identity theft</strong>. In this case, the account
holder’s identity has been compromised and a third party has requested a new
account by providing confidential information about the account holder. Any
account holder who believes that he or she may have been subject to identity
theft should contact the bank’s customer-service department. Once a
determination is made that an account has been compromised, investigation is the
responsibility of the bank. Unless a Government employee is determined to be
involved in the fraud, the agency generally does not participate in the
investigation. The account will be closed, and a replacement account opened.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Non-Cardholder Fraud Methods</strong>. Some of the different methods of
fraud include the following:</p>
      <p class="p">1) <strong class="ph b">Counterfeit Accounts</strong>. To make fake cards, criminals use the newest
technology to “skim” information contained on magnetic stripes of cards and also
to pass security features (such as holograms).</p>
      <p class="p">2) <strong class="ph b">Lost or Stolen Accounts</strong>. Physical cards are stolen from a
workplace, gym or unattended vehicle.</p>
      <p class="p">3) <strong class="ph b">Card Not Present.</strong> Internet fraud occurs whenever account
information is stolen and used to make online purchases. Merchant asks for the
CVC code (located on the back of the card) to help prevent this type of
fraud.</p>
      <p class="p">4) <strong class="ph b">Phishing</strong>. Phishing occurs whenever a CH receives a fake email
directing him or her to enter sensitive personal information on a phony website.
The false website enables the criminal to steal information from the account
holder.</p>
      <p class="p">5) <strong class="ph b">Non-Receipt</strong>. This type of fraud occurs whenever new or replacement
cards are mailed and then stolen while in transit.</p>
      <p class="p">6) <strong class="ph b">Identity Theft</strong>. A criminal applies for an account using another
person’s identity and information.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Detecting Non-Cardholder Fraud</strong>. One of the first signs that an
individual is a victim of fraud is at least one “mystery expense” showing up in
the monthly statement. To help detect fraud, cardholders should review their
statement by performing the following actions:</p>
      <p class="p">1) Look for transactions you do not recall making.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Check for unknown vendors.</p>
      <p class="p">3) Search for account withdrawals you do not remember making.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Avoiding Non-Cardholder Fraud</strong>. Cardholders should use the following
practices to avoid fraud:</p>
      <p class="p">1) Secure account number and information.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Safeguard your personal identification number (PIN). Do not write it down;
memorize it. Do not share your PIN.</p>
      <p class="p">3) Monitor your card during transactions. When the card is returned, check to
make sure it is yours.</p>
      <p class="p">4) Immediately report lost or stolen accounts and/or any questionable
charges.</p>
      <p class="p">5) Sign the back of a new card as soon as you receive it. If you do not
receive a replacement card before the expiration date of the older card, contact
the bank.</p>
      <p class="p">6) Destroy unwanted or expired cards. Shred or secure monthly statements and
receipts.</p>
      <p class="p">7) Electronically verify charges appearing on your monthly statement.</p>
      <p class="p">8) Unless you initiated the purchase, never give your account information
over the telephone, through the mail, or on the internet.</p>
      <p class="p">9) Consistently check your account for accuracy of personal and billing
information. Notify the bank if your personal information and/or address needs
updating.</p>
      <p class="p">10) Never let a telemarketer or salesperson pressure you into agreeing to a
deal.</p>
      <p class="p">11) Be aware of common scams and contact your A/OPC and the bank for unusual
situations.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">If Non-Cardholder Fraud Occurs</strong>. If fraud is detected on the
account, the CH must immediately report the incident to the following: BO, A/OPC
and servicing bank. The servicing bank will block and/or terminate the account.
If necessary, the bank will then issue a new card with a new account number.
Also, the bank will mail a “Statement of Fraud” letter to the cardholder, which
must be completed and returned promptly. Sometimes, unauthorized transactions
will appear on the billing statement, even though the account was reported lost
or stolen. Cardholders should report all unauthorized transactions by calling
the bank's customer service telephone number.</p>

    <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">Cardholder Fraud, Misuse and Abuse</strong>. This type of fraud
            occurs when a cardholder uses their account to transact business
            that is not sanctioned, not authorized, not in one’s official
            Government capacity, not for the purpose for which the card was
            issued, and/or not as part of official Government business.
            Intentional use of a Government account for other than official
            Government business constitutes misuse, and depending on the
            situation, may constitute fraud.</p>

        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Consequences of Cardholder Fraud</strong>. Cardholders have a
            responsibility to use the account to procure supplies and services
            at the direction of the Army under official purchase authorization.
            If a CH misuses the GPC or participates in fraud, the Army may
            cancel the purchase account and take appropriate disciplinary action
            against the CH. In the case of account misuse, the employee will be
            held personally liable to the Federal Government for the amount of
            any unauthorized transaction. Depending on the facts involved, an
            employee may be subject to fine or imprisonment for action relating
            to purchase account misuse and fraud. There are guidelines and
            procedures for disciplinary action to be taken against individuals
            for the improper, fraudulent, or abusive use of the purchase
            account. Purchase account misuse/fraud may have the following
            potential consequences:</p>
        <p class="p">1) Counseling</p>
        <p class="p">2) Cancellation of card account</p>
        <p class="p">3) Notation in employee performance evaluation</p>
        <p class="p">4) Reprimand</p>
        <p class="p">5) Suspension of employment</p>
        <p class="p">6) Termination of employment</p>
        <p class="p">7) Criminal prosecution</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">If Cardholder Fraud Occurs</strong>. If an A/OPC suspects that a BO
            or CH has committed fraud, the A/OPC can file a complaint with the
            Army Inspector General. Investigations are initiated upon receipt of
            a complaint or other information that gives a reasonable account of
            the wrongful or fraudulent act. The DoD hotline phone number is
            800-424-9098 to report fraud. A/OPCs should be as specific as
            possible when reporting fraud. The following information should be
            provided:</p>
        <p class="p">1) Employee's full name</p>
        <p class="p">2) Rank or pay grade</p>
        <p class="p">3) Duty station</p>
        <p class="p">4) Specific suspected fraudulent act or wrongdoing</p>
        <p class="p">5) Specific dates and times</p>
        <p class="p">6) Specific location of where the suspected fraudulent act
            occurred</p>
        <p class="p">7) How the individual completed the alleged fraudulent act</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Merchant Fraud</strong>. This type of fraud is committed by the
            merchant. Merchant fraud can occur either with or without the CH’s
            knowledge or consent. Rotating sources may help prevent this type of
            fraud. Billing errors, such as duplicate charges, are not considered
            merchant fraud. Examples include:</p>
        <p class="p">1) A vendor intentionally charges for items not delivered/services
            not performed.</p>
        <p class="p">2) A vendor offers bribes and gratuities to a Government employee in
            exchange for gaining purchasing activity.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">Reports for Identifying and Preventing Fraud</strong>. A/OPCs should use the
following reports to identify potential card misuse and fraud and to prevent
fraud from occurring:</p>
      <p class="p">1) <strong class="ph b">Declined Transaction Authorizations Report</strong>. This report identifies
cardholders who have attempted to use an account to buy an item for which they
are not authorized, that exceeds their single purchase limit, that exceeds their
monthly purchase limit, or from a merchant that falls under a blocked MCC.</p>
      <p class="p">2) <strong class="ph b">Transaction Detail Report</strong>. This report identifies the date,
merchant, reason code, dollar amount, and status of each dispute filed by CH.
BOs and A/OPCs should track and follow up on disputes to determine their
outcomes. Cardholders should attempt to resolve disputes directly with merchants
prior to filing a disputes report. If a merchant is consistently appearing on
the disputes report, the A/OPC should determine whether the merchant may have
billing issues, quality issues, or is attempting to commit fraud by submitting
false transactions.</p>
      <p class="p">3) <strong class="ph b">Unusual Spending Activity Report</strong>. This report identifies
transactions that may warrant further review.</p>
      <p class="p">4) <strong class="ph b">Account Status Change Report.</strong> This report lists accounts with a
change status of lost/stolen, closed, or reopened accounts. This status may
either be an indicator that the CH needs to secure the account or that the CH is
attempting to disguise misuse or fraudulent activity by denying the charges.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Reporting Fraud</strong>. All identified instances of suspected fraud or
abuse must be reported. Various channels of reporting include the Chain of
Command, the A/OPC, the command’s procurement fraud advisor (Staff/Command Judge
Advocate), the servicing Criminal Investigation Division office, internal review
organizations, and Inspector Generals at all levels. When a Defense criminal
investigative organization or Defense organizational element responsible for
investigating potential misconduct involving the GPC initiates an investigation
into allegations of charge card violations regarding a GPC, the CH’s commander
or second-line supervisor, as appropriate, and security manager must be
notified. Whenever possible, this notification should take place within 72 hours
of the initiation. See DoD Charge Card Guidebook A.1.11.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. Contingency contracting is the process of contracting for supplies,
services, and construction in support of contingency operations, defense against
or recovery from cyber, nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attacks
(also known as defense against or recovery from certain attacks), international
disaster assistance, an emergency or major disaster, and humanitarian or
peacekeeping operations. In accordance with FAR 2.101, when supporting
humanitarian or peacekeeping operations, the MPT is unchanged and does not enjoy
any increases whether the humanitarian or peacekeeping operation is taking place
inside or outside the U.S.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. Because contingency contracting and other emergency acquisitions are
frequently performed on short notice and without benefit of an established
office structure, certain acquisition and emergency flexibilities are prescribed
in FAR Part 13, FAR Part 18, DFARS Part 218, and DFARS 213.301. The elevated
thresholds will take effect during the operations listed in the definitions of
“micro-purchase threshold” and “simplified acquisition threshold” at FAR 2.101
and when the HCA determines the respective purchase will support such an
operation. DFARS 218.270 authorizes the HCA to make certain acquisition
determinations on behalf of the Head of the Agency.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. An increase in the MPT is authorized for purchases that have a clear and
direct relationship to the support of a declared contingency operation, defense
against or recovery from cyber, nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological
attacks, international disaster assistance, emergency or major disaster. In
order for emergency acquisition flexibilities to apply, the operations require
formal declaration. Cardholders are recommended to complete DAU’s Web-based
“Contracting for the Rest of Us” course, CLC 011, for CHs who are not in the
1102 career field and will be making contingency contracting purchases over an
extended period.</p>

Emergency Acquisition Flexibilities are defined in DFARS 218.2, Emergency Acquisition Flexibilities, and include the following: Contingency Operations; Defense or Recovery from Certain Attacks; Incidents of National Significance, Emergency Declaration, or Major Disaster Declaration; Humanitarian or Peacekeeping Operation; and Head of Contracting Activity Determinations. Emergency Acquisition Flexibilities increase the MPT and SAT with respect to the emergency identified in DFARS 213.201(a). Increased thresholds will be authorized in writing by the head of the contracting activity as defined in FAR 2.101.</p>

            Operations Cardholder and/or Check Writer” designation in their JAM
            appointment. Cardholders may only use this purchasing authority for
            declared, authorized contingency or emergency efforts. Purchases
            using this authority must have a clear and direct relationship to

            Level 4 A/OPCs must track purchases using the NIA code and conduct
            audits on the contingency purchases upon completion of the event.

            later than 31 August of the preceding fiscal year to the ODASA(P).
            ODASA(P) may grant, in writing, an extension to four years on a
            one-time basis when circumstances are justified. Additionally, the

            communication with all stakeholders to establish good working
            relationships and customer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction is
            the most significant external indicator of the success and
            effectiveness of all GPC services provided and can be measured
            through customer feedback. The A/OPC, BO, or CH will acknowledge
            valid customer feedback and investigate as appropriate. Customer
            feedback must be in writing detailing the nature of the issue and
            forwarded to the A/OPC, BO, or CH. Customer feedback may be obtained
            from the results of formal customer satisfaction surveys.</p>

            quality of the GPC service provided to include services provided by
            the GPC servicing bank. The quality of the services provided is

  <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title131">Chapter 14 - Prohibited and Restricted Purchases</h2>
  <div class="body">
      <p class="p List1">a. Cardholders are presented with requests to buy a wide variety of items
      and services, and it can be difficult for CHs to determine whether the
      requested purchase is authorized. This chapter describes the
      characteristics of an authorized purchase; identifies items and services
      that are prohibited and restricted from purchase; and the exceptions under
      which they are allowable.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. Cardholders must contact their A/OPC or other local authority (e.g.,
      legal advisor, HCA, or resource manager) before making purchases that seem
      questionable or have the appearance of being inappropriate. When buying
      questionable items or services, CHs must include approval documentation in
      the purchase file.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. All exceptions must be on a per transaction basis after consultation
      with the A/OPC, legal counsel, HCA, SCO, CCO, or resource manager.
      Multiple requests for the same exception must be approved by the Level 3
      or 4 A/OPC responsible for issuing the GPC accounts. There may be
      exceptions to the guidance in this section. For example, the armed escort
      of prisoners may be a legitimate use of the GPC even though “escort
      services” qualify as a prohibited transaction. CHs must include the
      results of their consultations and determination to use the GPC in this
      manner with their transaction supporting data.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">Determining whether a Purchase is Authorized</strong>. An authorized
purchase satisfies a current mission-related need at a fair and reasonable price
that meets all legal and regulatory requirements. It meets the following five
criteria:</p>
      <p class="p">1) <strong class="ph b">Lawful</strong>. Purchase is funded and authorized by law or regulation, and
the requested item/service fits the appropriation which is being used. See 48
CFR 13.301(a) and 31 USC 1301(a).</p>
      <p class="p">2) <strong class="ph b">Legitimate Government Need</strong>. Request is for official purposes and
not for the personal benefit of a Government employee.</p>
      <p class="p">3) <strong class="ph b">Bona Fide Need (Current Year Appropriation)</strong>. Request is for the
need of the current year of the appropriation. This rule does not prevent
maintaining a legitimate inventory at reasonable and historical levels. See 31
USC 1502.</p>
      <p class="p">4) <strong class="ph b">Minimum Needs of the Government</strong>. Request should not exceed what is
truly required. See FAR 11.103(c)(1).</p>
      <p class="p">5) <strong class="ph b">Fair and Reasonable Price</strong>. Price charged is fair to both parties,
considering the quality and timeliness of performance and delivery.
Micro-purchases may be awarded without seeking competitive quotes if the CH or
BO considers the price to be reasonable. Cardholders should obtain multiple
quotes if they suspect that the price is not reasonable or if buying a
supply/service for which no comparable pricing is readily available. See FAR
13.203(a)(3).</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Funding</strong>. Funds must be committed and obligated prior to purchase.
BOs must ensure that sufficient funds are obligated within the financial system
before providing approval to the CH to make the purchase. CHs must screen the
Purchase Request and Approval document to verify the BO has approved the
requirement to make the purchase. Purchasing before obligation of funds is a
violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act. For CHs who use GFEBS, a purchase request
with sufficient funding must have L4 approval before the card is swiped.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Contract Payments</strong>. If a valid procurement requirement has resulted
in the award of a Government contract, the GPC may be used as a method of
payment against the contract, even if the acquisition would otherwise be for a
GPC prohibited item.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">14-2.</span> Unauthorized Commitments and Ratification</h3>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. An unauthorized commitment (UAC) is defined by FAR 1.602-3(a) as “an
agreement that is not binding solely because the Government representative who
made it lacked the authority to enter into that agreement on behalf of the
Government.” See AFARS 5101.602-3-90. The only individuals who can bind the
Government are warranted contracting officers, ordering officials, and
cardholders acting within the limits of their delegated authority. The
individual making a UAC can be held personally liable to the vendor for the
total cost of supplies or services obtained until the extent of the Government’s
liability is determined. The primary factor in determining whether a purchase is
considered a UAC is contracting authority. CHs have this authority from their
appointment letter. When an individual without contracting authority initiates a
purchase, it is considered a UAC.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. GPC purchases must be approved by the BO prior to purchase and initiated
by the CH. The designated CH is the only person authorized to make purchases
with a GPC. FAR 1.602-3(b) requires agencies to take positive action to preclude
the need for ratification actions. Although procedures are available in cases
where it is necessary to ratify a UAC, these procedures may not be used in a
manner that encourages UACs being made by Government personnel.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. Payment for goods or services accepted in the absence of a UAC may be made
only through the ratification process. Payment cannot be made unless a
Contracting Officer has awarded a contract or an authorized GPC holder acting
within his or her delegation of authority has ordered the item(s).</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Examples of Unauthorized Commitments</strong>.</p>
      <p class="p">1) The Army receives services/supplies in which a properly executed funding
document and an authorized procurement method (e.g., contract, BPA, or GPC) was
not established prior to the Government ordering the services/supplies.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Someone other than the CH contacts a vendor and asks them to provide
supplies or perform work, without the CH’s knowledge and without prior approval
of the billing official.</p>
      <p class="p">3) An individual without contracting authority orders supplies or
services.</p>
      <p class="p">4) CH orders supplies or services exceeding their procurement authority.</p>
      <p class="p">5) A vendor mistakes a request for information as an order, ships the item,
the receiver does not realize it is an improper order and accepts the item
rather than reject and return the item.</p>
      <p class="p">6) A contractor continues to perform a service contract or provide
leased/rented equipment after the expiration date of the contract. This
situation frequently occurs on yearly services/maintenance/lease-type contracts
for which there is a continuing need.</p>
      <p class="p">7) An individual makes a commitment for continuation of services or delivery
of supplies under an expired contract, purchase order, or delivery order.</p>
      <p class="p">8) An individual makes a commitment which exceeds the call order limit on a
blanket purchase agreement.</p>
      <p class="p">9) A person who does not have delegated authority makes a commitment under a
BPA.</p>
      <p class="p">10) An individual makes a commitment which continues contract services over
and above the original scope and dollar amount.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Common Reasons for UACs</strong>.</p>
      <p class="p">1) Failure to plan procurement needs far enough in advance to utilize normal
contracting procedures.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Encountering emergency program requirements and not believing there is
enough time to go through normal procurement procedures.</p>
      <p class="p">3) Failure to expeditiously review, approve, and transmit procurement
requests to the Procurement Office.</p>
      <p class="p">4) Failure to perform extensive market research before taking an action.</p>
      <p class="p">5) Government officials not understanding the parameters of their actual
authority or lack thereof.</p>
      <p class="p">6) Government official not understanding that agreeing to an option presented
by a contractor could be an unauthorized action if it creates more work or
expense.</p>
      <p class="p List1">f. <strong class="ph b">Ratification Process</strong>. AFARS 5101.602-3-90 outlines the Army process
for ratifying an unauthorized commitment. Unauthorized commitments may be paid
by the Army through ratification. Ratification means the act of approving an
unauthorized commitment by an official who has the authority to do so. The
ratification process determines whether the Army or the initiator will pay the
invoice. The individual who made an unauthorized commitment can be held
personally liable to the vendor or the Government for the total cost of supplies
or services obtained until the extent of the Government’s liability is
determined. The Government accepts liability through ratification. When an A/OPC
identifies a potential unauthorized commitment, the A/OPC must contact the local
contracting office to initiate the ratification process. The ratification
authority may be delegated in accordance with agency procedures, but in no case
will the authority be delegated below the level of Chief of the Contracting
office, or equivalent.</p>
      <p class="p List1">g. <strong class="ph b">Payment of Properly Ratified Claims.</strong> A contracting officer can only
ratify the unauthorized commitment if it would have been proper to enter into a
contract before the commitment was made. After the unauthorized commitment is
ratified, the payment of the ratified claim may be made through an appropriate
contract action (e.g., award of a contract, modification to a contract, purchase
order, GPC). After ratification, the GPC may be used to satisfy the commitment
if the amount of payment is within the cardholder’s authority; if the payment is
made in the same fiscal year as the commitment; and if the commitment itself is
properly chargeable to the current fiscal year. If prior fiscal year funds are
required to satisfy the commitment, a purchase order, or other formal
contractual instrument, payable through Government vendor payment channels, will
be required. If the outstanding charges have already been paid in error with the
GPC prior to the discovery of the UAC, the UAC is being processed for
ratification only and the supporting documentation is loaded in the bank’s
EAS.</p>
      <p class="p List1">h. <strong class="ph b">Non-Ratifiable Commitments</strong>. An improper unauthorized commitment is
not ratifiable because it involves violation of a substantive legal requirement
or because the commitment exceeded the Contracting Officer’s authority.</p>
      <p class="p">1) Actions prohibited by law or otherwise improper are considered
non-ratifiable.</p>
      <p class="p">2) The Government is liable for the reasonable value of any goods or services
received by the Government. In such cases, the contracting officer should
document that although the UAC cannot be ratified, the vendor is entitled to
fair and reasonable payment for goods and services accepted (not necessarily the
same amount as the UAC). The contracting officer should resolve the UAC in a
different manner by contacting the mission area finance office.</p>
      <p class="p">3) If it is determined the non-ratifiable commitment should not be paid
(e.g., the Government did not receive and accept services) and/or the vendor
seeks review of a disallowance (in full or in part), the Contracting Officer
should seek legal advice.</p>
      <p class="p">4) FAR 1-602-3(d). Non-ratifiable commitments. Cases that are not ratifiable
under this subsection may be subject to resolution as recommended by the
Government Accountability Office under its claim procedure (GAO Policy and
Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal Agencies, Title 4, Chapter 2), or as
authorized by FAR 50.1. Legal advice should be obtained in these cases.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">14-5.</span> Split Purchases</h3>
   <div class="body conbody">
      
         <p class="p List1">a. A split purchase is the intentional
                  breaking down of a known requirement to stay within a CH’s
                  single purchase limit or the MPT to avoid other procurement
                  methods or competition requirements. Split purchases are
                  prohibited with the GPC (FAR 13.003(c)(2)). Requirements
                  exceeding the MPT should be directed to the contracting
                  office. Cardholders and A/OPCs should check with their legal
                  advisor if unsure whether a proposed purchase would be
                  considered split.</p>
         <p class="p List1">b. The requirement is the total quantity
                  and price known at the time of purchase. If a CH purchases as
                  they become aware of a requirement, the requirement is each
                  purchase. If a CH consolidates purchases and buys once a day,
                  the requirement becomes what was received during that day.</p>
         <p class="p List1">c. Examples of split purchases include,
                  but are not limited to, the following:</p>
      
      <p class="p List2">1) A single CH making multiple purchases
                  from the same merchant on the same day, the total of which
                  exceeds the single purchase limit, and the total requirement
                  was known at the time of the first purchase.</p>
      <p class="p List2">2) A single CH purchasing the same/similar
                  item(s) from multiple merchants on the same day, the total of
                  which exceeds the single purchase limit, and the total was
                  known at the time of the first purchase.</p>
      <p class="p List2">3) A single CH making multiple purchases
                  of similar items from the same or multiple merchants over a
                  period of time when the total requirement was known at time of
                  the first purchase and the value exceeds the single purchase
                  limit.</p>
      <p class="p List2">4) Multiple CHs under the same supervision
                  or BO purchasing the same/similar item(s) the same day or in a

                  do not meet the definition and are allowable to purchase with
                  the GPC. See common examples below:</p>
         <p class="p List2">1) Multiple purchases to the same vendor
                  which do not exceed the single purchase limit or MPT.
                  <strong class="ph b">Example</strong>. A CH makes two separate $100 purchases from
                  the same vendor on the same day. This situation is not a split
                  purchase because the combined total of $200 is below the
                  MPT.</p>
         <p class="p List1">2) Multiple purchases to the same vendor
                  when the CH purchases as requirements are received.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(a) <strong class="ph b">Example</strong>. A CH receives a $4,000
                  purchase request in the morning. He obtains funding and

                  receives an $8,000 purchase request to buy items from the same
                  vendor. He obtains funding and approval and places a second
                  order to the same vendor. This situation is not a split
                  purchase, because the CH was unaware of the second request
                  when he made the initial purchase. Even though the total cost
                  of both purchases exceeded the $10,000 MPT, the total known
                  requirement at the time of each purchase was below the
                  MPT.</p>
         <p class="p">(b) <strong class="ph b">Example</strong>. A CH receives a $6,000 purchase request on Monday. He
obtains funding and approval and places the order. On Wednesday, the CH receives
a purchase request from the same customer to buy additional items from the same
vendor for $5,000. He obtains funding and approval and places a second order to
the same vendor. This situation is not a split purchase, because the CH was
unaware of the second request when he made the initial purchase.</p>

    <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. The servicing bank provides Merchant Authorization Controls (MAC)
            in the form of Merchant Category Codes (MCC) and Merchant Category
            Code Groups (MCCG). MCCs and MCCGs categorize merchants by the goods
            and services they provide. They are used within the servicing bank’s
            card processing system to authorize or decline purchase transactions
            based on controls established for each GPC account. An MCC is a
            four-character numeric code with a corresponding description that
            reflects the merchant’s primary business. An MCCG is a logical
            grouping of MCCs.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Merchant Category Code (MCC)</strong>. A code assigned by the
            merchant’s bank to categorize each merchant according to the type of
            business in which the merchant is engaged and the kinds of supplies
            or services provided. These codes are used as authorized transaction
            codes on a card/account to identify the types of businesses
            providing authorized supplies or services. DPC maintains the list of
            DoD-wide blocked MCC codes. The servicing bank uses MasterCard’s
            Merchant Category Codes (MCCs) to categorize merchants based on the
            types of goods or services they provide. When an A/OPC adds MCCs to
            a Cardholder or Managing Account profile, it enables that specific
            account to make purchases from vendors categorized under that
            MCC.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Tier 1 MCCs</strong>. The servicing bank has placed a hard block on
            merchants with Tier 1 (Very High Risk) MCCs. The bank will decline
            all attempted transactions from vendors with these MCCs. Tier 1 MCCs
            may be unblocked upon approval by the Level 2 A/OPC, on a
            case-by-case basis. All purchases from merchants associated with
            Tier 1 MCCs will generate a data mining case in IOD.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">15-1.</span> Contract Payments</h3>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. Given the continuing evolution of electronic payment capabilities, the
Army must periodically perform reviews of existing payment practices to optimize
effectiveness. These reviews should consider factors such as ease of use,
opportunities to generate revenue from payment processes ("refunds"), price
discounts for faster vendor payment, transaction fees, transaction data, and
internal controls.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_15-1__Hlk112839449">b. The GPC may be used as a payment method on contracts. See
FAR 32.1108. The Contracting Officer will make the determination and choose to
use the GPC as the payment method for CHs to make contract payments on formal
contract vehicles up to the limit of the Contracting Officer’s warrant when the
GPC payment method is proven to be more advantageous to the Government.
Contracting officers are required to ensure contractor invoices are accurate.
Benefits to increasing GPC contract payments include greatly increased refunds
per effort expended, exemption from GPC data mining, and faster receipt of
payments. On average, vendors are paid within 3 to 4 days with a GPC. Additional
benefits may include decreased paperwork and costs, improved reconciliation,
reduced labor-intensive processes, and reduced fraud and charge-back risk.
Warranted contracting officers do not require a separate authority letter to use
the GPC. Contracting Officers normally appoint CHs residing in the contracting
office as GPC contract payment CHs. The Contracting Officer or an A/OPC with the
appropriate delegating authority may appoint GPC contract payment CHs outside
the contracting office providing the Contracting Officer or A/OPC with the
appropriate delegating authority provides adequate training and oversight.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. The contract must be properly entered in the financial management system
with the correct LOA, and the LOA must be entered into the servicing bank’s EAS
to ensure the financial management system posts the payment against the
appropriate contract line item number. All modifications impacting payment
and/or funding (including options exercised) must be re-coordinated with the RM,
CH, and BO to ensure the financial management system and the bank’s EAS are
properly updated. Failure to do so will result in the servicing bank not being
paid which may result in a possible account delinquency. The CH will maintain
supporting documentation in the bank’s EAS for each contract payment made using
the GPC.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. At a minimum, procedures will be in place to ensure proper separation of
duties to safeguard Government resources and to avoid the posting of double
obligations associated with the use of the GPC to make payment on existing
contract vehicles. Contracts where the GPC is used as the method of payment are
required to be fully funded. No progress (finance) payments are authorized.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">FPDS-NG</strong>. Contracting Officers are responsible for ensuring the FPDS
reporting is completed.</p>
      <p class="p List1">f. FAR policy requires the consent of contractors when contemplating the use
of GPC as the payment method. Consent is typically obtained by including FAR
clause 52.232-36 in the solicitation and, if the contractor does not object, the
contract. Existing contracts may be modified to include the clause, with the
consent of the contractor. The vendor, not the Army, pays the bank an
interchange fee of approximately 3% of the transaction amount.</p>
      <p class="p List1">g. <strong class="ph b">Contract Payment Processes</strong>. The servicing bank has two different
methods for contract payments: a payment card process and a Payment Plus
process. See 15-4 and Figure 15-1 for a description of the payment card process.
See 15-5 and Figure 15-2 for a description of the Payment Plus process.</p>

  <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p">FAR 32.1108 and 32.1110(d) provide instructions for use of the
      appropriate clause when payment under a written contract is made by GPC.
      When using the GPC for contract payments, the contracting officer will
      insert the FAR clause 52.232-36, Payment by Third Party, in solicitations
      and contracts. Payment by a purchase card may also be made under a
      contract that does not contain the clause at 52.232-36, to the extent the
      contractor agrees to accept that method of payment. When the clause at
      52.232-36 is included in a solicitation or contract, the contracting
      officer will also insert the clause at 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic
      Funds Transfer—Central Contractor Registration, or 52.232-34, Payment by
      Electronic Funds Transfer—Other Than Central Contractor Registration, as
      appropriate. The contracting officer should also insert DFARS clause
      252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving
      Reports. </p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. Wide Area Workflow (WAWF) is a secure, web-based system for electronic
invoicing, receipt and acceptance. WAWF allows Government vendors to submit and
track invoices and receipt/acceptance documents over the Web and allows
Government personnel to process those invoices in a real-time, paperless
environment. WAWF is in accordance with the 2001 National Defense Authorization
Act (DFARS 252.232-7003/252.232.7003 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests -
January 2004), which requires claims for payment under a DoD contract to be
submitted in electronic form.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. DFARS Appendix F contains procedures and instructions for the use,
preparation, and distribution of the WAWF Receiving Report (RR) and commercial
shipping/packing lists used to document Government contract quality assurance.
Preparation instructions and training for the WAWF RR are available at <a class="xref" href="https://piee.eb.mil/" target="_blank">PIEE</a>. The instructions on preparing a WAWF RR are part
of the Vendor Training section.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. On March 3, 2008, DoD issued a final rule amending the DFARS to require
use of WAWF as the only acceptable electronic system for submitting requests for
payment (invoices and receiving reports) under DoD contracts.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. WAWF helps to mitigate interest penalty payments due to lost or misplaced
documents and highlights vendor-offered discounts so that the DoD benefits on
both fronts, in addition to streamlining the whole process from weeks to days or
minutes. Benefits include online access and full spectrum view of document
status, minimized re-keying and improving data accuracy, eliminating unmatched
disbursements, and making all documentation required for payment easily
accessible.</p>

  <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. Wide Area Workflow must be utilized when making contract payments with
      the GPC per DFARS 232.7002, 232.7003, and 252.232-7003. The contractor
      must use WAWF to create the purchase card receiving report (PCRR) when the
      GPC is used as a method of payment. The CH provides the following
      information to the contractor to submit PCRR into WAWF:</p>
      <p class="p"> </p>
      <p class="p">1) Vendor Identifier: Vendor/Company Name</p>
      <p class="p">2) Payment Office: CRCARD </p>
      <p class="p">3) Ship to:</p>
      <p class="p">4) Inspect by: </p>
      <p class="p">5) Accept by: </p>
      <p class="p">6) Card Issuing Bank ID: 556862 </p>
      <p class="p List1">b. The contractor then uses WAWF to create and submit the PCRR. Upon
      notification that the goods have been received, the Government acceptor
      accepts the PCRR in WAWF. The CH verifies that acceptance has occurred in
      PIEE/WAWF and that the contracting officer has approved the invoice. The
      CH submits the invoice, receiving report, copy of the contract and
      modifications, and a current obligation/disbursement sheet to the BO for
      approval. After acceptance of the property in WAWF, data will flow to the
      Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) based on the Pay DoDAAC<em class="ph i">.</em>
      Indicating “CRCARD” as the payment office prevents double obligation and
      data from entering the payment process. </p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">17-1.</span> Program Metrics</h3>
    <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. A/OPCs have a number of reporting tools that enable them to manage
            their purchase program effectively through the bank’s EAS. Most
            electronic reports are updated within two to three days after a
            transaction. However, some reports are only updated at the end of
            the billing cycle. A/OPCs will have access through the EAS to
            monitor account holder transactions at any time. By searching by
            account holder name or account number, A/OPCs can track account
            holder transactions (e.g., transactions, payments, disputes), as
            well as view account holder monthly statements. A/OPCs may also
            contact the bank’s customer service at any time to request
            information on a specific account.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. Program metrics will be implemented in each contracting office to
            provide the SCO, A/OPCs, and key Army officials with an assessment
            of the risk environment and feedback as to whether card programs are
            satisfying overall strategic goals. All A/OPCs will utilize the
            reports identified in Table 17-1 and 17-2 to review performance
            metrics and any systemic deficiencies requiring corrective
            action(s).</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. A/OPCs should maximize utilization of reports available on the GPC
            Business IT systems web sites such as the IOD and AXOL. The reports
            can assist with conducting periodic and annual surveillance
            inspections along with overall GPC Program management. Many reports
            are available through the servicing bank’s EAS, IOD, and PIEE system
            to assist A/OPCs in the management and oversight of the GPC program.
            In addition to reviewing these reports, A/OPCs at all levels should
            perform and maintain certain metrics to assess the performance of
            their program. These metrics include, but are not limited to, the
            following:</p>

            users to analyze vital program data to support program management
            and vendor relationships. All Access Online reports are
            parameter-driven and have different parameters based on the data
            elements available for each report. Users can run reports by
            performing three basic steps:</p>
        <p class="p">1) Select the report. Begin by accessing the custom reports function
            and then navigating to and selecting the custom report you want to
            run.</p>
        <p class="p">2) Specify parameters. Set parameters for the report, such as date
            range.</p>
        <p class="p">3) Run the report. After specifying any report-specific parameters,
            select to run the report or save and then run the report.</p>

      <p class="p">A/OPCs should save copies of all electronic reports that they generate, particularly statistical or summary reports. Due to the volume of information available, the bank will furnish information for a limited period (generally, 18 months or less) before archiving the data. Reports containing sensitive information (e.g., account numbers, account holder information, etc.) should be maintained in a secure location.</p>
