      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_5133.204__enuFtn">(a) As used in this section:</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_5133.204__FNXVVz">“Dispute Resolution Specialist” means the official designated by the head of an agency to implement agency ADR policy as prescribed by Section 3(b) of the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1996, 5 U.S.C. 571-584 and Note. The Principal Deputy General Counsel of the Army is designated the Army Dispute Resolution Specialist.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_5133.204__gTNFSx">“Issue in controversy” means a material disagreement between the Army and a contractor that may result in a claim, or is all or part of an existing claim.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_5133.204__eqecxl">(b) Contracting officers and their legal counsel, assisted by other members of the Acquisition Team as necessary, are encouraged to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to resolve pre-appeal disputes (e.g., claims, unresolved requests for equitable adjustment, and other issues in controversy) to the maximum extent practicable and appropriate. For any dispute in which unassisted negotiations have reached impasse or in which the contracting officer has received a request for ADR, the contracting officer shall review the dispute to determine whether ADR is appropriate for resolving it, applying the reasons listed in paragraph (c) of this section. If the contracting officer finds ADR to be appropriate, the contracting officer should offer or agree to ADR. Participation in ADR does not obligate any party to settle or accept a proposal for settlement. This section does not create any right to ADR for any contractor or prospective contractor, and a decision by the contracting officer finding ADR to be inappropriate is not subject to appeal.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_5133.204__aPCTeU">(c) The use of ADR to resolve an issue in controversy is generally authorized if the parties agree. However, the contracting officer or other authorized official may decide that ADR is inappropriate to resolve the issue for any of the following reasons:</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_5133.204__qzjMQF">(1) A definitive or authoritative resolution of the matter is required for precedential value, and an ADR proceeding is not likely to be accepted generally as an authoritative precedent.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_5133.204__WhBbQl">(2) The matter involves or may bear upon significant questions of Government policy that require additional procedures before a final resolution may be made, and an ADR proceeding would not likely serve to develop a recommended policy for the Army.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_5133.204__pcelEq">(3) Maintaining established policies is of special importance, so that variations among individual decisions are not increased, and an ADR proceeding would not likely reach consistent results among individual decisions.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_5133.204__utFaam">(4) The matter significantly affects persons or organizations who are not parties to the ADR proceeding.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_5133.204__vqnCgN">(5) A full public record of the proceeding is important, and an ADR proceeding cannot provide such a record.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_5133.204__GXInZo">(6) The Army must maintain continuing jurisdiction over the matter with authority to alter the disposition of the matter in the light of changed circumstances, and a dispute resolution proceeding would interfere with the Army’s fulfillment of that requirement.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_5133.204__aVnBGk">(7) The issue is amenable to a disposition that will fully resolve the matter quickly and with a high probability of finality, including procedures under Rules 11 and 12 of the Rules of the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA).</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_5133.204__INSMCG">(8) The anticipated transaction costs of ADR in money and time materially exceed the anticipated transaction costs of litigation.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_5133.204__UTagKg">(9) The dispute involves one or more credible allegations or indications of fraud, gross mismanagement, abuse of official authority, or violation of federal or state criminal laws.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_5133.204__XtaMYI">(10) Any other specific reason why the contracting officer determines ADR is inappropriate. Sole reliance on this provision to find ADR inappropriate must be approved by the cognizant senior contracting official (SCO), or higher authority.

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">(a)  <em class="ph i">Judgment Fund.</em>
      </p>
      <p class="p List2">(1)  The Disputes statute provides for the use of the Judgment Fund (“the Fund”) (31 U.S.C. 1304) to pay for adverse judgments against the Government.  Under certain circumstances, the Army can convert settlement agreements in Disputes statute cases before the ASBCA into consent judgments to access the Judgment Fund to pay for settlements.  In Disputes statute cases before federal courts where Department of Justice represents the Army, the Department of Justice may use its independent authority to use the Judgment Fund for settlements.  Contracting officers should consult with their legal counsel and their local resource management office prior to taking any actions related to the use of the Judgment Fund.  Only authorized officials of a federal agency may submit a request for payment from the Judgment Fund.  Requests submitted by anyone other than an authorized federal official are deemed fraudulent.  Filing a false or fraudulent claim constitutes a Federal offense that is punishable by fines, imprisonment, or both.  (See 31 U.S.C. 3729 and 18 U.S.C. 287.)  The authorized official for Army is the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Financial Management and Comptroller).  See Appendix GG for further delegation.  Army contracting activities shall follow the policy set forth in this section of the AFARS.</p>
      <p class="p List2">(2)  The Army must reimburse the Judgment Fund with funds current as of the date of the judgment.  According to the Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation, (DoD FMR), Volume 3, Chapter. 8, paragraph 080304F.5, approval authority is required from the cognizant Assistant Secretary of the Military Department (Financial Management and Comptroller) or Defense Agency Comptroller for all Judgment Fund Reimbursements to the Department of the Treasury in excess of $1,000,000.</p>
      <p class="p List1">(b)  <em class="ph i">Fiscal considerations in settlements.  </em>If funds appropriate to pay a settlement are expired but the account remains open, contracting officers must use expired funds to pay the settlement.  If the account remains open but no expired funds remain, contracting officers must use the Judgment Fund to access current funds to pay the settlement.  Access to the Fund requires a consent judgment from the Board or use of the Department of Justice’s independent authority to use the Fund.  The contracting officer may use current funds to pay the settlement if appropriate accounts are canceled or closed.</p>
      <p class="p List1">(c)  <em class="ph i">Settlement procedures</em>.</p>
      <p class="p List2">(1)  The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Financial Management and Comptroller) (ASA(FM&amp;C)), tracks available expired funds within the Service.</p>
      <p class="p List2">(2)  The Army shall use the following procedures for settlements:</p>
      <p class="p List3">(i)  In situations where contract funds have expired but the accounts have not closed, the Army shall fund settlements with expired funds if available.  Contracting officers will ascertain the availability of appropriate expired funds through their resource management office.</p>
      <p class="p List3">(ii)  If the resource management office determines that no expired funds exist within the Army to fund the settlement and the accounts are not closed, the contracting officer must access the Judgment Fund through a consent judgment in order to use current year funds to pay the settlement (i.e., reimburse the Fund).</p>
      <p class="p List3">(iii)  If no expired funds exist but the account remains open, use the following procedure.  If current year funds are available to reimburse the Fund, then the contracting officer may enter into a consent decree and allow the Fund to pay the judgment.  If there is not sufficient current funding to reimburse the Fund, the contracting officer must receive authorization from the ASA(FM&amp;C) prior to entering into a consent decree.</p>
      <p class="p List3">(iv)  If the accounts are closed, use the following procedure.  If the contracting officer has sufficient funds to pay the settlement, he/she will not use the Fund, and pay the settlement with Agency funds.  If sufficient current funds are not available, ASA(FM&amp;C) will provide approval to access the Fund prior to the contracting officer entering into a consent judgment.</p>
      <p class="p List3">(v)  When use of the Judgment Fund is authorized, the contracting officer shall work with the resource management office to ensure execution of the appropriate Certificate of Finality and Financial Management Service forms (FMS Forms 195, 196, 197A and 198 (if appropriate)) and submit the payment request to the FMS.  The “reimbursement contact” on FMS Form 196 shall be the ASA(FM&amp;C).</p>
      <p class="p List1">(d)  <em class="ph i">Judgments</em>.  Use the following procedures to pay judgments using the Judgment Fund.</p>
      <p class="p List2">(1)  The contracting officer shall ascertain the availability of current funds through financial management channels.  If current funds are available, the contracting officer will not use the Fund, and will pay the judgment with Agency funds.</p>
      <p class="p List2">(2)  If current funds are not available, the contracting officer will pay the judgment using the Fund after proper coordination and authorization from the ASA(FM&amp;C).</p>
      <p class="p List1">(e)  <em class="ph i">Settlement agreements</em>.  All settlements converted to consent judgments and funded by the Judgment Fund shall be in writing and contain appropriate release language.  The contracting officer, local attorney and trial attorney shall insure that all settlement amounts are fair and reasonable.</p>
      <p class="p List1">(f)  <em class="ph i">Expeditious handling. </em> To expedite handling of settlements, inquiries and approvals that these procedures require may be oral so long as the contracting officer documents them in a memorandum for record.</p>
