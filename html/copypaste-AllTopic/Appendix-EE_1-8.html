        <p class="p">The different types of delegation of authority appointments
            identified in this section and Table 1-3 are available to CHs as
            needed. Each authority has unique policies, procedures, training,
            and oversight requirements. CHs must have the appropriate
            designation in their JAM appointment in order to use the
            corresponding purchasing authority. These appointments can only be
            granted to individuals who have completed training commensurate with
            their delegated authority.</p>

            1402 Certificate of Appointment to purchase supplies and services as
            prescribed in DFARS 213.301(3). Contracting officers may use this
            authority to make purchases up to the applicable simplified
            acquisition threshold in support of declared contingency or
            emergency events.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Contract Ordering Official.</strong> This authority allows CHs with
            the appropriate training to issue fixed-price orders against
            existing contracts (e.g., GSA FSS, BPAs, FedMall contracts, CHESS
            contracts) to fulfill mission-essential requirements for supplies
            and services valued up to the Contract Ordering Official single
            purchase limit and to use the GPC to pay for these orders/purchases.
            When using this authority, CHs must 1) ensure they are authorized to
            place orders by the contract terms and conditions, 2) ensure the
            order will comply with all the contracts terms and conditions, and
            3) follow all applicable ordering procedures. When ordering above
            the MPT, CH should obtain pricing from small business when
            small business can meet the requirements. The CH should obtain
            quotes from at least three sources. If restricting competition to
            fewer than three sources, the CH should document the circumstances
            in the purchase file. CHs with this designation will be referred to
            as “Ordering Officials” throughout this document.</p>

            used outside the U.S., and that comply with the requirements of
            DFARS 213.301(2). When ordering above the MPT, the CH should obtain
            quotes from at least three sources. If restricting consideration to
            fewer than three, document the circumstances in the purchase
            file.</p>

            GPC may provide a streamlined way of paying for contracts when a
            contracting officer determines the use of the GPC is in the best
            interest of the Government (AFARS 5113.202-90(d)).</p>

            training conference, or instructional service that is available to
