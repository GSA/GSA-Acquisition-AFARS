      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-1__monHHk">a. This document provides the procedures to be used within the Army to establish and manage the Army Government Purchase Card (GPC) program. Best practices are identified in Appendix A. Army activities may adopt more stringent internal control requirements than the requirements cited herein. However, as these are risk-managed programs, activities should maintain a proper balance between the control environment and ease of use to ensure that the benefits of the card continue to accrue. These procedures establish Army-wide standards designed to provide all Army activities with a foundation upon which to build specific standard operating procedures governing their programs.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-1__RVbCpG">b. Nonappropriated activities implement policies and procedures governing the Army’s morale, welfare, and recreation programs and general policies on Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities (NAFI). Chaplaincy activities implement policies and procedures governing Army Chaplain Corps activities. Army NAFIs/entities must operate within the parameters of these procedures.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-5__UmWUgf">a. The Chief of the Contracting Office (CCO) shall delegate micro-purchase procurement authority to individuals at the lowest level in accordance with FAR Part 1-603-3(b). This authority may be redelegated in writing to the Level 3 or 4 Agency/Organization Program Coordinator (A/OPC). Sample appointment letters are located at Appendix F.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-5__rTEoUV">b. Orientation and training on the Army purchase card program is a prerequisite to receiving a GPC.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-5__hqLJds">c. Generally, only government employees can be cardholders. However, a number of exceptions apply:</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-5__mrIhkK">(1) Under certain conditions, GSA can authorize contractors to establish cards directly with the issuing bank, if necessary. (DOD Guidebook page A-1). Requests for GPC by contractors working under cost type contracts shall be forwarded to the Army contracting officer for the cost-reimbursable contract. If the contracting officer determines that the contractors are eligible, the contractors must file a Request for Eligibility Determination with the GSA SmartPay contracting officer. (AFARS 5113.202-90(b)).</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-5__bILLDj">(2) Foreign nationals may be designated as accountable officials - Billing Officials (BOs) and Cardholders (CHs) provided they are direct hires, even though they may not be subject to pecuniary liability under U.S. law. Given the above, purchase cards may be issued to foreign national employees of the Army if they meet accountable official requirements (nomination and training). They are subject to the same disciplinary actions for card misuse as U.S. citizen employees, subject to host country agreements and local law. (DOD Guidebook page A-1 and DOD FMR Volume 5, Chapter 33, paragraph 330204)</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-5__zIoQkl">(3) Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC) Instructors are members of the Armed Forces in accordance with AR 145-2, paragraph 4-3, and may be designated micro-purchase procurement authority as GPC cardholders. (FAR Part 1-603-3(b))</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-5__oLXRDv">d. Army cardholders who are ordering officers may be authorized to use the GPC as a payment instrument for orders made against Federal Supply Schedule contracts (FSS), Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs), DOD Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts that contain a provision authorizing payment by purchase card, or other contracts when authorized by the contracting officer.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-5__YXgFNH">e. The GPC may provide a streamlined way of paying for contracts and other contracts than those listed above, but a contracting officer shall first determine that use of the GPC is in the best interest of the government (AFARS 5113.202-90(d)). See FAR Subpart 32.1110(d) and 32.1108 for instructions for use of the appropriate clause when payment under a written contract is made through use of the card. If payment under a written contract is made by the GPC, then the contracting officer shall insert the FAR clause 52.232-36, Payment by Third Party, in solicitations and contracts. Payment by a purchase card may also be made under a contract that does not contain the clause at 52.232-36, to the extent the contractor agrees to accept that method of payment. When the clause at 52.232-36 is included in a solicitation or contract, the contracting officer shall also insert the clause at 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer—Central Contractor Registration, or 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer—Other Than Central Contractor Registration, as appropriate.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-5__OOIisZ">f. The maximum single transaction dollar limit for the GPC for stand-alone purchases shall be the micro-purchase threshold as defined at FAR 2.101, DFARS 213.301(2) and AFARS 5113.270-90. The maximum single transaction dollar limit for contract payments against existing contracts shall be as identified in the contract and shall be within the limits defined in the CH written Delegation of Authority letter or the contracting officer’s warrant. In the event of an emergency need for contingency or humanitarian aid operations, the Executive Office of the President may sign into law an emergency procurement authority allowing increased GPC and convenience check limits and revised procedures in support of contingency and humanitarian aid operations. In such circumstances, the Director of Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy also may authorize class deviations to allow organizations to deviate from the FAR and DFARS. Such deviations may include raising GPC spending limits. These contingency/emergency purchases require separate training and Delegation of Authority by the A/OPC on contingency/emergency procedures and authority must be issued/granted by the Chief of Contracting or other authorized person.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-5__YRQWnC">g. The GPC shall be used to pay for government-owned material or government-performed services received from other government sources (e.g. Defense Logistics Agency Document Services, GSA Global, and Defense Logistics Agency).</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-5__qykaJC">h. The GPC shall be used as a method of payment for all commercial training $25,000 and below. The Standard Form (SF) 182 must be completed for training up to $25,000. If training costs exceed $25,000, submit the training requirement to your local contracting office. A separate and dedicated training GPC card must be issued and used to purchase training. These GPC training cards are only used to purchase training requirements.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-5__LMbhDO">i.Where it is identified that the purchase is processed via a third party merchant (such as PayPal), the CH should make every attempt to choose another merchant with whom to procure the goods and/or services. If found necessary to procure using a third party payment merchant, the BO must ensure adequate supporting documentation showing that there was a detailed review of the purchase and that the use of the third party payment merchant was unavoidable.</p>

      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-6__gqlmpI">These procedures apply to all GPC purchases with cards issued by the Army. Non-Army tenant organizations issued Army GPCs or convenience checks by an Army contracting office are also subject to these procedures. All BOs, CHs, A/OPCs (at all levels), Resource Managers (RMs), Logisticians, and other stakeholders that participate in the GSA SmartPay Purchase Card Program under the Army Level 2 hierarchy are subject to these procedures. The policy established in this document supersedes previous guidance issued in the Draft Army Regulation (AR715-xx). Explanation of the Army level hierarchy is provided at 1-8.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-8__kudjip">a. Responsibility for the establishment and operation of an agency’s GPC program is delegated to the agency’s Senior Contracting Official (SCO). The SCO, or in activities that do not have a SCO, the Chief of the Contracting Office (CCO), designates a Level 3 A/OPC and an alternate(s) who once appointed is dedicated to the GPC Program within their agency/organization.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-8__gQmCGf">b. The SCO or CCO forwards the Level 3 A/OPC Appointment Letter to the Level 2 A/OPC using the template found at Appendix F. The letter delegates responsibility for managing the agency GPC program and details responsibilities, training and certification requirements, and grade level preferences for the Level 3 A/OPC role. The Level 2 A/OPC reviews the nomination and ensures the Level 3 A/OPC meets all requirements of the position. Once approved, the Level 2 A/OPC provides written endorsement and coordinates Level 3 A/OPC appointment with the servicing bank. The Level 2 A/OPC is the final approval authority for agency Level 3 A/OPC appointments.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-8__VuEREK">c. SCOs must ensure adequate resources are dedicated to the GPC program within their agency/organization to ensure successful management of the program. Adequate GPC resources refer to an agency’s efficient and effective deployment of assets (such as number of personnel, training, funding, facilities, knowledge and skills, etc.) when and where needed to meet agency requirements in compliance with the laws and regulations governing the GPC Program. Adequate resources must be deployed to reasonably ensure that programs achieve their intended results; resources are used consistent with agency mission; programs and resources are protected from fraud, waste, and mismanagement; laws and regulations are followed; and reliable and timely information is obtained, maintained, reported and used for decision making.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-8__IsgsgH">d. Individuals meeting the following criteria may be appointed as Level 3 or 4 A/OPCs for the GPC Program; GPC knowledge, training, and experience, basic contracting knowledge and/or acquisition training. The Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA) requires the Department of Defense to establish education and training standards, requirements, and courses for the civilian and military workforce. The DAWIA certification requirements are located at <a class="xref" href="https://dap.dau.mil/career/pur/Pages/Certification.aspx" target="_blank">
            <u class="ph u">DAU Certification Requirements</u>
         </a>. DAWIA contracting or purchasing certification includes a training, education, and experience requirement. The Army requires Level 3 and Level 4 A/OPCs to be DAWIA Level II certified in contracting. A/OPCs that are not DAWIA Level 2 certified in contracting must either complete the DAWIA Level 2 contracting training requirement within 24 months or achieve DAWIA Level 2 certification in purchasing within 24 months of being assigned to the Level 3 or Level 4 A/OPC position. This requirement is effective immediately upon appointment of all A/OPCs. Although the Level 3 A/OPC position typically warrants a minimum equivalent grade of GS-13 or higher, the grade depends on the responsibilities, complexity, and volume of the program. In addition to certification requirements, Level 3 and 4 A/OPCs are required to have completed the training requirements detailed in Section 2-2.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-8__fLrMqp">e. The SCO management responsibility authority for the GPC Program is further delegated to the CCO. The CCO must ensure adequate resources are dedicated to the GPC program within their installation/activity to allow effective administration of the program. The CCO coordinates with the local personnel office(s) to ensure procedures are established requiring individuals involved in the GPC Program to clear through the Level 4 A/OPC when they out-process from the installation. The Level 4 A/OPC is appointed at a sufficient grade/rank to exercise their authority depending on the responsibilities, complexity, and volume of the program. Only individuals who meet the criteria in paragraphs 1-8(d) may be appointed as A/OPCs for the GPC Program.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-8__pFVgKL">a. The Level 3 and 4 A/OPCs must have the following knowledge, skills, and abilities:</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-8__DtJgbA">(1) understanding of the relevant policies, procedures, and commercial contracting practices;</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-8__GhLlde">(2) understanding of the relevant procurement laws and regulations;</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-8__fDbtiJ">(3) understanding of what constitutes and authorized purchase transaction;</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-8__RFcDNN">(4) understanding of procurement methods and standards;</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-8__rMtets">(5) ability to communicate, organize, and manage effectively;</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-8__keAVwy">(6) basic analytical and computer skills;</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-8__mOiTUx">(7) ability to summarize data, draft reports and write effectively using proper grammar, punctuation, and tone;</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-8__LtcKTw">(8) ability to analyze, research, and provide concise recommendations to the chain of command on required actions to anticipate, prevent, or correct problems in business processes that are supported by the GPC.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_2-1__LboFZE">a. Nomination, selection, and appointment of CHs and BOs are in accordance with AFARS Part 5113. The nominating official must be in the supervisory chain of the individual being nominated. CHs, BOs, and Checkwriters must be issued written authority identifying their limits of authority, duties, responsibilities, credit limits, and the written authority must reference mandatory compliance with the AFARS Subpart 5113.2 and the Army Government Purchase Card Operating Procedures. The BO, or CH will acknowledge receipt (electronic signature and date permissible) of appointment letters. Warranted contracting officers do not require a separate delegation of authority to use the GPC.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_2-1__vlXJVO">b. The CH is also a Departmental Accountable Official (DAO) according to paragraph 3305 and 3306, Chapter 33, Volume 5, of the DOD FMR. CHs must successfully complete the required GPC and ethics training to be delegated micro-purchase authority prior to receiving a GPC (see paragraph 2-2). The SCO or COC may delegate in writing to the Level 3 or 4 A/OPC the authority to delegate micro-purchase authority to CHs. A sample delegation of micro-purchase authority is provided at Appendix F.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_2-1__AatiEz">c. The BO is also a Certifying Officer within the context of the GPC program. The Certifying Officer’s minimum qualifications and eligibility are further discussed in DOD FMR Volume 5, Chapter 33. BOs are responsible for the accuracy of payments, including designation of the proper appropriation(s) or other funds certified to the paying office and Disbursing Officer. BOs are financially responsible for any illegal, improper, or incorrect payment as a result of an inaccurate or misleading certification. To certify GPC invoices for payment by the DFAS, the BO must be appointed as and accept the responsibilities of a Certifying Officer using the DD Form 577 and complete ethics and fiscal law training (see paragraph 2-2). The BO completes and signs the DD577 and provides to the A/OPC in order for the A/OPC to set up the BO account. The A/OPC provides the original signed and completed DD Form 577 to the supporting DFAS, ATTN: GPC. The BO and A/OPC retain a copy.</p>

      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_2-3__lQilwP">a. GPCs are issued only as mission requirements dictate. Only DOD civilian employees, military personnel, or members of the Armed Forces may be issued a GPC or be appointed a BO. GPCs may not be issued to contractor personnel, except as provided in Section 1-6. Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC) instructors, OCONUS local national employees of the Army, and host Government direct hires for OCONUS agencies/organizations whose salaries are reimbursed by the Army, are not considered DOD contractors, and may be designated as CHs and BOs.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_2-3__wQekiy">b. The spending limits and cycle limits can be changed as necessary to meet operational needs.

      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_2-3__jxZpzd">c. Each GPC account has a single purchase transaction limit and monthly purchase limit. Generally the single purchase limit is the micro-purchase threshold. The cumulative spending total of all CHs’ monthly purchases make up the billing cycle limit for the BO. Total monthly purchases may not exceed the billing cycle limit that is established in the Servicing Bank’s transaction authorization system. The CH’s monthly spending limits are modified by the RM in AXOL when operational circumstances warrant. The Level 4 A/OPC is notified of the monthly spending limits change, approves the change, and forwards the change to the Servicing Bank.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_2-5__JHllGt">a. Use of the GPC by an authorized CH to make an unauthorized purchase is the liability of the Government. However, the installation/organization is responsible for taking appropriate action against the CH including efforts to recover the funds.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_2-5__QySiYE">b. The intentional use of the GPC for other than official Government business may be considered an attempt to commit fraud against the U.S. Government. Misuse may result in immediate cancellation of an individual's card, financial liability, and negative administrative and/or disciplinary action against the CH and, if warranted, against the BO.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_2-5__SMoGFM">c. Liability: GPC BOs are personally and pecuniarily liable for the full amount of any improper payments resulting from misuse, abuse, or unauthorized purchases of the GPC, in accordance with Title 31 U.S.C. § 3528. Strict pecuniary liability attaches automatically when there is an erroneous (illegal, improper, or incorrect) payment. GPC CHs are pecuniarily liable for erroneous payments that result from the negligent performance of duties in the amount of erroneous payment, up to one month’s pay. All accountable officials are required to comply with DOD regulations, policies, and procedures, including standard operating procedures. Failure to act in accordance with such regulations, policies, and procedures is generally considered evidence of negligence. Following orders from superiors that are contrary to regulations, policies, and procedures, is no defense to negligence or bad faith. A heavy workload or a lack of experience, supervision, or training, is not a factor in determining relief from liability.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_2-5__NFgZSJ">d. Statutory authority: Any misuse of the GPC is subject to criminal, civil, Uniform Code of Military Justice, administrative, and disciplinary actions as appropriate.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_2-5__lCqwEp">(1) CHs: DOD FMR defines a CH as a DAO, and as such, are liable for up to one month’s pay for misuse resulting from their negligent actions. DOD Directive 7000.14-R imposes financial liability for negligent performance of the CH’s duties. The FMR Vol. 5, Chapter 33, §3309 also discusses pecuniary liability. Accountable Officials shall be personally and pecuniarily liable for erroneous payments that result from the negligent performance of duties in the amount of the erroneous payment, up to one month’s pay.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_2-5__jtldxy">(2) BOs: Title 31 U.S.C. §3528 provides for personal and pecuniary liability for improper payments resulting from misuse/abuse of the purchase card for Certifying Officials. The GPC BO meets the definition for Certifying Officer in the DOD FMR. The BO is financially liable for improper payments resulting from misuse or abuse of the GPC. The act of certifying a billing statement for payment makes the BO financially responsible for illegal, improper, or incorrect payment due to an inaccurate or misleading certification. Consequently, a BO who knowingly makes a false certification may be asked to repay the Government for the items or service purchased. If a BO is unsure about certification, he/she should contact the supporting Level 4 A/OPC for guidance and/or assistance.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_2-5__EkyUGo">e. Investigation Required: When a review/audit of the GPC account indicates questionable purchases, to include unauthorized purchases, the reviewer must ask the Certifying Officer for justification. If there is no justification, the reviewer must notify the BO’s Commander or Director. The Commander or Director must conduct an investigation in accordance with AR 15-6. The investigation must provide the DOD employee or military member with an opportunity to rebut the presumed liability. Failure to follow regulation and policy constitutes negligence.</p>

      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_2-6__SIjVAj">(2) BO’s account goes over 180 days past due (210 days after the billing date) all accounts assigned under the respective Level 4 A/OPC is suspended.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_2-6__JGmYMl">(3) BO’s account has more than 20 open Card and/or checking accounts, the BO’s account is suspended unless a waiver has been approved by the Army Level 2 A/OPC.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_2-6__btVgqe">b. Only the Army Level 2 A/OPC may reopen suspended accounts before the cause of the suspension has been corrected. Before reopening a closed account due to a delinquent payment, the Level 3 A/OPC documents the payment was made to the Servicing Bank to clear the delinquency. Accounts will be closed permanently if more than two suspensions occur within a 12-month period. Only the Army Level 2 A/OPC may approve waivers to this policy.</p>

UNICOR), and FSS/GSA schedule requirements. In addition to those mandatory sources listed in FAR Part 8, cardholders should strongly consider using small and small disadvantaged businesses whenever possible. The AbilityOne Program is a mandatory source of supply, with any procurement method and at any dollar value, in compliance with the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled statute, (41 U.S.C. §8501-8506).

         </a>. Waivers are granted when products are unavailable on CHESS contracts or when hardware and software is available at a lower price from an alternate source. A CHESS waiver does not constitute approval to purchase any product or deviate from any other Army regulation or policy. Individual waivers are approved by CHESS and Army organization/activity blanket waivers are approved by the Army Chief Information Officer (CIO)/G-6. There is no fee associated with using CHESS and cardholders should maximize the use of discounts when ordering off CHESS contracts.</p>
      <p class="p" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-5__Frmmtj">If no small business capability exists, CHESS contract vehicles are the preferred source for acquisition of IT services.

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-6__TCtPsH">a. OMB standards for internal controls require that key duties and responsibilities be divided or segregated among individuals to ensure they do not exceed or abuse their assigned authority, OMB Circular A-123, Appendix B Revised, paragraph 4.3. Separation of duties is an internal control activity, intended to provide checks and balances to the GPC process, to prevent or minimize innocent errors or intentional fraud occurring without detection. This is done by ensuring that no single individual has control over multiple phases of a purchase card transaction. To protect the integrity of the procurement process, no one person is responsible for an entire purchase card transaction. Key purchase card functions must be handled by different individuals. Inadequate separation of duties could allow errors and fraud to occur without detection. Key duties, such as making purchases–CH, authorizing payments–BO, certifying funding–RM, and reviewing transactions–Level 4 A/OPCs and PBOs must be assigned to different individuals in order to minimize the risk of loss to the Government to the greatest extent possible.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-6__NozBPx">b. If resource constraints prevent assignment of the key duties to different individuals, as set forth in paragraph (a) above, the activity must request a waiver through the Level 4 A/OPC and the CCO to the Level 3 A/OPC for approval, and will require additional surveillance.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-6__wPEOBn">c. Notwithstanding the above-described waiver process, certain key duties must not be assigned to the same individual. In no case shall the same individual be the CH and the BO for a GPC account. In no case shall the CCO, Property Book Officer, or any Level 4 A/OPC (primary or alternate) also be a CH, BO or contracting officer who is making contract payments with a GPC or executing GPC purchases. A CH, who is a hand receipt holder, should not purchase property for their own use.

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-7__QExBUq">a. The Army standard for span of control for a Level 4 A/OPC is 300 accounts. This number includes both BO and CH accounts. A ratio of not more than seven card accounts to an A/BO is the Army standard. Ensuring a reasonable number of card accounts are assigned to each A/BO or Certifying Officer account is paramount to the effective accomplishment of the A/BO or Certifying Officer’s responsibilities. The total number of transactions, as well as the number of assigned card accounts, must be considered when determining an acceptable account-to-A/BO ratio. Span of control refers to the extent of oversight and review responsibilities placed on a single A/OPC or BO. An appropriate span of control must efficiently and effectively allow the A/OPC or BO to provide reasonable assurance they can effectively perform their responsibilities regardless of the number of accounts assigned. The assigned span of control must factor in a Level 4 A/OPC’s responsibility to conduct an annual review of all BO accounts including semi-annual surveillance of 25% of all transactions under his/her oversight. A span of control too large may preclude the A/OPC from accomplishing this task effectively and efficiently.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-7__CoyjKx">b. When the number of accounts (300:1 accounts per A/OPC) or workload complexity/administration assigned to a Level 4 A/OPC exceeds the Army standard, the SCO and the CCO must ensure adequate resources are made available to allow the Level 4 A/OPC’s successful performance of his or her duties. When the span of control exceeds the Army standard by more than 10 percent and the CCO elects not to provide additional resources, the CCO must provide the SCO with formal documentation stating that the CCO has personally reviewed the existing span of control and has determined the span of control is adequate to ensure program administration and surveillance can be performed at a satisfactory level. The Level 3 A/OPC must retain a copy of this documentation.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-7__CayLdw">c. When the ratio for CH accounts to BOs exceeds the Army standard, the BO shall prepare a request for a waiver to policy. The approval levels for waivers are indicated in paragraph 3-7e. The total number of transactions as well as the number of assigned CH accounts must be considered when determining an acceptable card and/or checking account-to-BO ratio.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-7__tXzhYw">d. Upon the nomination and approval of a prospective CH and during the annual review of BO accounts, the Level 4 A/OPCs determines if the span of control is acceptable—that is, whether the BO can reasonably be expected to complete a thorough review of all transactions and certify the invoice within five business days of its receipt.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-7__aGUSlZ">e. The Level 4 A/OPC documents all cases where the CH-to-Billing Official ratio exceeds the Army standard. In these cases, the BO prepares a request for a waiver to policy. The request must address the unique conditions that affect the process and show, with a high degree of certainty, that the BO can be expected to comply with the review and certification procedures. The request must include the number and location of assigned CHs, the total average number of transactions made by the CHs, the amount of time the BO can devote to the certification process, the history of delinquencies, and other factors that seem appropriate. The waiver is approved at the following level indicated below and maintained by the approver with copies furnished to the BO:</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-7__tEDpMH">(1) 8–10 CHs accounts: Through the Level 4 A/OPC to the CCO.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-9__YKOEWK">a. Surcharges are fees that a retailer adds to the cost of a purchase when a customer uses a charge/credit card. As a result of the settlement between a class of retailers and the brands, on January 27, 2013, merchants in the United States and U.S. Territories are permitted to impose a surcharge on cardholders when a charge/credit card is used.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-9__GqBtaY">b. Not all merchants impose a surcharge, and some states (California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Oklahoma and Texas) have laws which do not allow or limit surcharges. Cardholders who receive a surcharge or a check out fee in any of the above mentioned states should report the merchant to the state Attorney General’s Office.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-9__mIvrRY">c. Surcharges may not be added to debit, prepaid or cash purchases and cardholders are required to be notified in advance of making the purchase if a merchant will impose a surcharge. Merchants must also include the surcharge fee on any receipt(s) provided to the cardholder.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-9__TcwPCl">d. Per Visa and MasterCard guidance, there is a limit to the allowable surcharge amounts. These limits vary by brand and by merchant discount rate. Information on surcharge limitations for Visa and MasterCard is available at:</p>

      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-9__uLFUlo">e. A/OPCs should ensure cardholders and other charge card management personnel are aware of the possibility of surcharges when making purchases using credit/charge cards. If a merchant is imposing a surcharge, the cardholder should consider choosing another merchant that offers the same or similar item(s) to avoid paying the surcharge.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-11__p_OLE_LINK16">a. The CH reconciles the statement of account throughout the month by reviewing it for accuracy and comparing it with his or her purchase log entries. If the statement is correct, the CH approves it within three business days from the end of the billing cycle. If the statement is incorrect, the CH must contact the merchant and request correction. If the merchant does not cooperate or provide the ordered goods and services, the CH disputes the incorrect transaction.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-11__dEFVdG">b. The BO must ensure GPC transactions are legal, proper, and correct in accordance with Government rules and regulations. If the billing statement is correct following the BO’s review throughout the month, certification of the billing statement is done within five business days from the end of the billing cycle. If the BO finds questionable transactions, the CH must be contacted to review supporting documentation. If the BO determines the CH is negligent, the BO takes appropriate action in accordance with DOD and Army policy, and informs the Level 4 A/OPC of the action taken. Disputes must be filed by one of three methods: calling the Servicing Bank, faxing over a Cardholder Statement of Questioned Items form or using the Servicing Bank’s dispute process in AXOL, within 60 days of the cycle end date in which the transaction appeared in order to retain the Government’s dispute rights.</p>

The date received, along with the signature (or electronic alternative when supported by appropriate internal controls), printed name, telephone number, and office designator or address of the receiving official will be recorded on the sales invoice, packing slip, bill of lading, or other shipping or receiving document as confirmation of receipt. The billing official verifies the existence of receipt and acceptance documentation during reconciliation of the billing statement.</p>

      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-12__UgsKlH">a. The Army certifies invoices for payment after all purchased items have been confirmed. This procedure has been called “Confirm and Pay”. Each BO must establish a system to flag and track all transactions certified for payment with proof of receipt and acceptance. This procedure ensures all transactions reconciled and approved for payment have receipt verified.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-12__WLBUWI">b. Under the following condition, the Army has adopted the following process in order to allow the Servicing Bank to be paid for items that have been shipped by the merchant but not received by the organization to prevent withholding payment of the entire billing statement for a few transactions. Transactions that have been reconciled and approved for payment will have receipt verified no later than 45 days after the date of the original invoice.

The approving or certifying official maintains certified billing statements and supporting documents for six years and three months in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), General Records Schedule (GRS) 6, “Accountable Officers’ Accounts Records”. See DOD FMR Volume 15, Chapter 6 for additional information on document retention for accountable officers’ records (10 years from the date of case closure for Foreign Military Sales).</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-13__GZAkjP">b. All financial records, both paper and electronic, must be retained documenting the GPC transactions in a file to include (1) the BO statement, (2) the CH statement, and (3) all original receipts and documentation for those statements.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-13__p_OLE_LINK10">c. Receipts are considered supporting documents for the certified billing statement and in accordance with the DOD FMR, Volume 1, Chapter 9, must be retained for six years and three months after final payment. Original receipts are preferred; however, printed electronic forms or copies of an itemized receipt are acceptable. The receipt must be legible; goods must be itemized/detailed with the item description, quantity, price, and extended price; indicate vendor’s name and address; date of the purchase; and must indicate paid by credit card or zero amount due. The BO maintains these records, either physically in his/her physical possession, or when appropriate transfers to a records holding area. However, if certifying electronically, the CH and BO may rely on the Servicing Bank recordkeeping for the BO and CH statements. Original records are the property of the U.S. Government and may not be removed from government control by the BO for any reason.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-13__mSeddJ">d. Level 4 A/OPCs shall retain hard copy file documentation for Government credit card files documenting application for cards and approval, account maintenance, letters of GPC delegation (CH or BO), ethics certification (if applicable), required training certifications, results of annual reviews, and related information for three years after the fiscal year in which the card account is cancelled.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">3-14.</span> Convenience Checks and Foreign Draft Checks</h3>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__xshUjw">a. Convenience checks and Foreign Draft Checks (FDCs) provide activities with the flexibility to issue checks for payment of supplies and services. With the exception of contingencies, convenience checks shall not be written over the micro-purchase threshold. Convenience checks are issued for domestic purchases valued in U.S. dollars when the merchant does not accept the GPC. DOD activities have the flexibility to issue convenience checks to pay for products and services at the activity level. FDCs are issued for overseas purchases valued in foreign currency when the merchant does not accept the GPC. The following requirements apply to one or both of these financial instruments as specified.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__bSwhIR">b. The CH shall not use a convenience check or FDC unless its use is considered advantageous to the activity after evaluating all alternative methods of purchase. Convenience checks and FDCs may not be used to avoid the normal GPC payment process. Before a check is issued, the paying agency must make every effort to use the GPC, including making maximum efforts to find and use merchants that accept the GPC. The authority to maintain a checkbook shall be justified on an individual organization basis and controlled and monitored by the organization’s CCO. The number of checkbooks per installation must be kept to a minimum. A delegation of procurement authority is granted in writing by the CCO for the maintenance and use of convenience checks.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__ZrACMc">c. Convenience checkbook accounts are available only to organizations that maintain active GPC accounts in good standing. A convenience checkbook holder may have a GPC account and a separate convenience checkbook account. Convenience checks are pre-numbered, and their use is controlled with a separate convenience check purchase log for each account. Checkbook holder shall maintain original voided checks.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__iCsIMh">d. Convenience checks and FDCs are not issued for more than the micro-purchase threshold (or the foreign currency equivalent), and must be issued for the exact payment amount. In the case of an FDC, the payment amount includes the administrative processing fee. However, in the case of convenience checks, the payment amount does not include the administrative processing fee. The convenience check processing fee is added by the servicing bank during processing of the transaction, and the addition of the processing fee is not considered a split requirement. “Splitting” payment amounts across more than one convenience check or FDC to keep the purchase amount per check below the micro-purchase threshold limit is prohibited. Convenience checks and FDCs will not be issued as an “exchange-for-cash” vehicle to establish cash funds. If merchants issue credit or refunds by cash or check, the funds must be immediately credited to the account against which the purchase was originally made.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__rfjIEp">e. Convenience checks and FDCs are negotiable instruments and must be stored in a locked container, such as a safe or locking filing cabinet. Checks must be accounted for appropriately to prevent loss, theft, or potential forgery. Convenience check and FDC accounts must be reviewed quarterly by a disinterested party and not the A/OPC. The checks are reconciled just as other GPC transactions, as a part of the monthly statement billing cycle. Copies of voided checks must be retained through the carbon copy or photocopy the original check as a part of the account-holder's original documentation files.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__EHLYVf">f. The same purchase prohibitions that apply to the GPC apply to the convenience check and the FDC.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__FrZbzw">g. The normal dispute process associated with the GPC is not applicable to convenience checks and FDCs. Any concerns over a purchase made with a check must be resolved directly with the merchant. The check writer is solely responsible for securing credit or disputing purchases with the merchant. Each organization is responsible for all checks written on an account; unless it is determined fraud is involved (see Section 4-5 on fraud). In some cases, payment can be stopped on a convenience check that has been written if the check has not yet been posted to an account. To stop payment on a check, the check-writer must call the Servicing Bank’s Customer Service Department to receive instructions on processing the action.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__fprbou">h. FDC accounts are established in the contracting office. Customer activities desiring FDC accounts outside the contracting office must justify, in writing, to the CCO why an account is necessary. FDC BOs, cashiers, and custodians must receive standard GPC training prior to being issued active FDC accounts.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__EMCumm">i. The check cashier is the only person who has the authority to issue and sign checks. He or she may hold a GPC account in addition to the convenience check FDC account, as long as the accounts are maintained separately.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__LmKCJu">j. The check custodian orders, receives, stores, issues, inventories, reconciles, and disposes of FDC stock. He or she is not responsible for approving and processing requirements for check writing.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__HFjUZN">k. The BO authorizes and certifies the issuance of FDCs written by the cashier. In order to maintain effective internal controls, the BO may not perform the check-writing and maintenance functions of the cashier and custodian. All convenience checks and FDCs must be reconciled as a part of the monthly billing statement at the end of the billing cycle.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__SrjGai">l. Establishing Convenience Check Accounts. Any U.S. Government employee, military or civilian, including local national employees, may be selected for appointment as a check writer. Contractors working for the Army must not to be selected for appointment. Requests to establish convenience check accounts must be justified in writing by the organization’s Commander/Director and forwarded to the Level 4 A/OPC. If approved, a delegation of procurement authority is granted in writing by the CCO, for the maintenanceand use of convenience checks. Required information must consist of the following:</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__geiYIf">(1) Reason for requesting checks</p>

      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__fLkdsu">m. Use of Convenience Check Accounts.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__OPDtja">(1) Convenience checks may be used for small purchases, when supplies or service are available for delivery within 15 days whether at the contractor’s place of business or at destination. Convenience checks must not be used for employee reimbursements, cash advances, cash awards, travel-related transportation payments, or meals. Purchases made with the check must not require detailed specifications or an inspection report. Convenience checks should not be used for recurring payments.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__niSMFw">(2) Convenience checks may be used for purposes not related to small purchases when such expenditures are authorized by other regulations such as:</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__lQDmjz">(a) Delivery charges associated with the purchases made with a convenience check when the contractor is requesting to arrange delivery. These charges include local delivery, parcel post including cash on delivery (COD) postal charges, and line haul or inter-city transportation charges, provided the charges are determined in the best interest of the Government.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__gPepIS">(b) C.O.D. charges for supplies ordered for payment with a convenience check upon delivery.</p>
      <p class="p" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__PiOUnd">n.Tax Reporting - The 1099 Tax Reporting Process (TRP) was developed to collect convenience checks written for services, rent, medical and health care services and other Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requirements. This data is used to process IRS 1099-MISC forms. The BO is responsible to monitor the check writer's compliance with 1099-TRP.</p>
      <p class="p" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__NAUNvc">(1) Convenience check holders must submit check data to DFAS on any checks they issue for tax reportable categories. This should be done throughout the year and is suggested to be completed monthly, and can be done on-line once the check writer and their corresponding A/OPC officially request access to the 1099 TRP. The 1099 TRP is restricted to authorized users only. Access is optional for the BO, but may be necessary to fulfill the BO's responsibility to ensure the check writer is compliant with 1099 TRP.</p>
      <p class="p" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-14__bbkrxa">(2) 1099 TRP System Access: To obtain access, users must complete two system access forms, DD form 2875 and DD form 2869. The link to access the System Access Request Forms is: <a class="xref" href="https://dfas4dod.dfas.mil/systems/1099/" target="_blank">https://dfas4dod.dfas.mil/systems/1099/</a>. Carefully follow the instructions for completing the forms. All check writers and A/OPCs must complete both forms.

Exceptions to the mandatory use of the BPAs and DOD EMALL are as follows:</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-15__IRQfTO">(1) This policy does not apply to purchases made Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS).</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-15__BGIlgn">(2) Purchases made directly from AbilityOne or from AbilityOne Base Supply Centers (BSCs). Cardholders may purchase office and cleaning supplies directly from AbilityOne Base Supply Centers and are exempt from using the Office Supply BPAs. These products are available at Base Supply Centers on military installations or in federal buildings.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-15__FXqWNE">(3) Cardholders may purchase National Stock Number (NSN) items directly from AbilityOne BSCs and are exempt from using the Standard Army Retail Supply System (SARSS) or the Office Supply BPAs. When NSN products are not available from the BSCs, then cardholders should use the SARSS to purchase NSN Products.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-15__PqbZKX">(4) <span class="ph">Purchases made from wholesale supply sources such as stock programs of the General Services Administration</span> (e.g. GSA Global Supply Center).</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-15__jYfRbG">(5) Cardholders may purchase an item from another source if an urgent need exists for an unplanned requirement needed for the same day. Poor acquisition planning and inadequate market research would not apply to this exception. Use of this exception requires valid documentation and retention in the purchase card file.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-15__KLoIWt">(6) NAFI cardholders must comply with the required sources (see paragraph 3-5). When purchasing office supplies, NAFI GPC cardholders shall consider the AbilityOne Base Supply Centers or the Office Supply BPAs on the DOD EMALL Army Corridor as a practical choice. If it is not in the best interest of the NAFI to purchase through AbilityOne Base Supply Centers or the Office Supply BPAs, the cardholder may consider other required sources. The cardholder must adequately document the decision to not purchase from the AbilityOne Base Supply Centers or the Office Supply BPAs before an open-market source can be considered.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-15__etRgli">(7) In the event the DoD EMALL is unavailable for more than 24 hours, cardholders may place orders with the Office Supply BPA vendor through another form of communication.</p>

      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-16__hSgyck">a. Rebates are posted as credits against billing statements and applied at the billing statement level unless specified otherwise by the Level 2 A/OPC. Rebates are automatically assigned to the default line of accounting (LOA) on the billing statement. BOs should reallocate the rebates across various LOAs (of the same appropriation) to the extent that no single LOA has a credit balance. Under no circumstance will the CH retain gift checks, vendor rebates or other purchase incentives that can be converted to personal use. If received, these items must be turned over to the U.S. Treasury.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-16__zyMrfm">b. Unless specific authority exists allowing rebates to be used for other purposes, rebates must be returned to the appropriation or account from which they were expended, and can be used for any legitimate purchase by the appropriation or account to which they were returned, or as otherwise authorized by statute.</p>

Reimbursements such as rebates, merchant credits, or other credits attributable to accounts closed during the quarter or accounts not having enough purchases to offset the credit, require the Servicing Bank to issue quarterly checks to the Level 4 A/OPC. Merchant credits must be applied back to the funding appropriation. Rebates must be used in the fiscal year they are received.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_3-16__hTjmgr">e. Each Level 4 A/OPC is directed to deliver all reimbursement check(s) to their RM within five (5) days of receipt, retain a copy of each reimbursement check(s), and obtain the RM's signature acknowledging their receipt and acceptance of the reimbursement check(s). The CH, BO, and RM should have a process to ensure adequate controls are in place to track credits and rebates. Questions related to reimbursements in the form of a rebate, merchant credit, or other credit should be directed to your local RM. CHs must forward their monthly cardholder statement to the BO with the appropriate supporting documentation, within 5 working days, to maximize rebates and minimize prompt payment penalties.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-1__FjpiEf">a. This section provides specific management controls required of GPC programs, guidelines for disciplining abusers, and other control information. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-123, Appendix B, provides additional guidance on implementing strong internal controls. PCOLS is designed to both maintain the integrity of these controls and validate their effectiveness in safeguarding Government resources. Management officials are responsible for establishing a process of internal controls that is (1) designed to provide reasonable assurance that the GPC program is used efficiently, effectively, and legally to achieve the purpose for which the program was established and (2) is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-1__KFvHaS">b. Required Management Controls include:</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-1__OWIAFN">(1) <strong class="ph b">Maintain Purchase Log:</strong> All CHs are required to maintain either an electronic or a manual log (if not electronically enabled) for each transaction made using the card.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-1__qKEwdH">(2) <strong class="ph b">Maintain Positive System of Funds Control</strong>
         <strong class="ph b">:</strong> Spending limits (such as monthly and office limits) are tied directly to the funding allocated for each card account (monthly, quarterly, and semiannually). Fund limits should be consistent with historical spending patterns to minimize Government exposure and ensure adequate funds availability. This provides an overall control to ensure funding is available prior to purchases being made with the card.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-1__huCfMV">(3) <strong class="ph b">Ensure Separation of Duties</strong>
         <strong class="ph b">:</strong> For the GPC, a mandatory management control is the separation of duties. Key duties such as making purchases (CH), verifying purchases are proper (A/BO), authorizing payments (BO and FSO), certifying funding (Finance and Resource Managers), independent acceptance for accountable property, and reviewing and auditing functions (A/OPC and Property Book Officers) must be assigned to different individuals to the greatest extent possible to minimize the risk of loss to the Government.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-1__GcMVJW">(4) <strong class="ph b">Reconciliation/Approval by the CH</strong>
         <strong class="ph b">:</strong> During each billing cycle, CHs are required to reconcile the CH statement they receive from the issuing bank against the purchase card log they are required to maintain for card purchases.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-1__PtSLZF">(5) <strong class="ph b">Reconciliation/Approval by the A/BO:</strong> After the CH has approved his/her entire CH statement, he/she forwards the electronic or hard copy file to the cognizant A/BO. The A/BO is required to approve or reject each purchase made by the CHs under his/her hierarchy. When the A/BO has completed their review of each invoice submitted for his/her card accounts, the A/BO, acting in the role of Certifying Officer, can certify the entire invoice as legal, proper, and correct in accordance with his/her responsibilities.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-1__pjgjpQ">(6) <strong class="ph b">Exercise Dispute Authority</strong>
         <strong class="ph b">:</strong> The CH has 60 days from the date of the billing statement to dispute the transaction.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-1__ZFfvmO">(7) <strong class="ph b">Exercise/Maintain Authorization Controls:</strong> Appropriate spending limits and Merchant Category Code (MCC) access are tailored to each CH account. Spending limits and MCC access should reflect historical buying patterns/trends.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-1__MRrHSD">(8) <strong class="ph b">Systems Access Security:</strong> Appropriate safeguards must be in place to control issuance and safeguarding of access credentials to the EAS.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-1__WJocDB">(9) <strong class="ph b">Available Funding Integrity:</strong> Certified lines of accounting (LOAs) must be traceable through disbursement. All changes to LOAs must be documented and certified.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-1__ogBzBR">(10) <strong class="ph b">Invoice Integrity:</strong> An electronic certification process ensures the original electronic invoice is traceable from the vendor through the certification and entitlement processes and retained in a Government record. Should the original invoice submitted by the contractor be in paper form, the Certifying Officer shall determine if the invoice is proper for payment and affix his/her signature in accordance with the governing provisions of the <a class="xref" href="http://comptroller.defense.gov/fmr/05/05_33.pdf" target="_blank">
            <u class="ph u">DoDFMR</u>
         </a>. If appropriate, the Certifying Officer makes any required “pen and ink” changes on the original invoice to reallocate the payment to different funding lines from those reflected on the original invoice. The Certifying Officer determines whether these changes are proper and affix his/her signature with the standard certification language on the original paper invoice.</p>

The Level 4 A/OPC must conduct a review of 100% of BO accounts annually to include a minimum representative sample size of 25% of transactions for each BO account. The A/OPC should utilize PCOLS Data Mining/Risk Assessment (DM/RA) reviews, transactional reports from the Bank’s EAS (or other electronic oversight process), DoD Checklist and Certification Template (appendix D), and the Formal Reporting Requirements Template (Appendix G) to perform the review.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-2__GLUMrL">b. Reviews may be conducted in person, remotely, or electronically depending on the size, complexity, and past review history of the BO account. Reviews should focus on transaction activity and overall adherence to the purchase card program requirements, as well as provide a response to previous findings and recommendations and resulting corrective actions taken. Results of the review should be documented and briefed to the BO and the BO's supervisor detailing findings, discrepancies, issues, and/or identifiable trends.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-2__aDfQvP">c. In conjunction with reviewing all BO accounts annually, the Level 4 A/OPC is responsible for drafting a semi-annual surveillance report and providing it to the Level 3 A/OPC (due April 21st and October 21st). The report should address all aspects of the activity’s GPC program, including BO/CH account/transaction reviews; appointment and account issuance/maintenance; GPC usage requirements; GPC documentation, processing, and financial requirements; convenience check writer requirements; and training.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-2__IGRrUd">d.In reporting BO/CH account and transaction data, the review should include the following: at least 25% of transactions based on a representative sample of data, inclusion of high risk transactions as flagged in Access Online and PCOLS, and transactions from every BO and CH account. The semi-annual surveillance report must thoroughly analyze and summarize all items addressed in the DoD Checklist and Certification Template (Appendix D) and the Formal Reporting Requirement Template (Appendix G). The report should be all-inclusive as to provide a clear, precise representation of the agency GPC Program and its daily operations.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-2__rHIhrt">e. Level 3 A/OPCs must conduct semi-annual reviews of all Level 4 Programs within their oversight and must provide a formal semi-annual report (due May 1 and November 1) to the Army Level 2 A/OPC. The report should provide the results of the surveillance programs for their prospective organization, should summarize repetitive or systemic weaknesses by activity, and should address all aspects of a surveillance plan. The surveillance report should provide a detailed summary of the reports provided by his/her respective Level 4 A/OPCs. The report must be drafted and presented to the Level 2 A/OPC using the template found at Appendix H which summarizes all aspects of the GPC Program, consistent with the DoD Checklist and Certification. All area of the template should be fully analyzed, discussed, and supported with metrics, concrete examples and evidence that a surveillance plan was implemented and surveillance conducted throughout the reporting period.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-2__AHvmiW">f. The Level 2 A/OPC will provide an Army-wide GPC Semi-annual surveillance report describing the Army GPC Program. The report will identify trends, corrective actions, and dates for implementing changes throughout the GPC community to support identified program trends, strengths and weaknesses. The Level 2 A/OPC may interview Level 3 and/or Level 4 A/OPCs to gain further insight into GPC trends across the Army GPC program and may perform a separate random sample review of GPC transaction to determine whether or not identified trends are substantiated.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-2__sAlxNR">a. Review reports must be maintained on file for six years and three months. Repeat findings from the previous fiscal year review report may result in suspension of your account.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-4__lktkqM">a. PCOLS is a DoD-wide suite of electronic systems that GPC officials use to improve the management and accountability within their GPC program organizations. PCOLS is comprised of five applications: Enterprise Monitoring and Management of Accounts (EMMA), Authorization, Issuance, and Maintenance (AIM), PCOLS Reporting, Data Mining (DM), and Risk Assessment (RA). PCOLS is Common Access Card (CAC) enabled to ensure secure authentication and nonrepudiation. Due to enhancement of program oversight, the Purchase Card On-Line System (PCOLS) is mandated for GPC participants Army-wide and accessible at: <a class="xref" href="https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/appj/pcols-web/" target="_blank">

         </a>.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-4__gCtZvD">b. <u class="ph u">EMMA</u> is used to capture and define organizational purchase card hierarchies, document authority chains, and identify relationships among purchase card roles. EMMA increases the accuracy of personnel data and institute more robust inclusion of supervisors (e.g., cardholder and managing account supervisors). EMMA acts to electronically define the GPC hierarchy, the roles within the hierarchy, and assigns individuals to those roles. Additionally, EMMA enables the A/OPC to alter or remove any personnel from assigned roles reflecting changes to hierarchy structures, also known as provisioning.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-4__GphuTV">c. <u class="ph u">AIM</u> is used to initiate, approve, and transmit requests for GPC issuance and maintenance actions. AIM draws from hierarchies (e.g., role responsibilities and permissions) established in EMMA. It directly engages GPC supervisors, helps ensure business rules comply with internal organizational management controls, and is a workflow tool performing various GPC Program account authorization and maintenance functions.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-4__psItaF">d. <u class="ph u">Data Mining (DM)</u> programmatically reviews 100% of the DoD purchase card transactions using sophisticated intelligent/learning software and identifies correlations, patterns, and trends in purchase card buying actions. This transaction review allows daily, near-real-time mining of the data. The Case Manager, which is an integral component of DM, interprets the referred transactions and creates specific cases that are assigned to the Approving/Billing Officials (A/BOs) for review. Through the use of the Case Manager Interview Process, the A/BO demonstrates that due diligence is exercised in the review of the referred transactions. With this DM tool, scarce human resources can be targeted on identified high-risk transactions and maintain a record of actions taken on referred transaction reviews for improved internal audit ability of the program.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-4__yBeZYF">e. <u class="ph u">Risk Assessment (RA)</u>, together with results from the DM Application, assess and report on the overall "health" of a DoD organization's purchase card program. RA allows users to monitor risks associated with their purchase card program. Users assess the risk of their purchase card program by monitoring certain risk controls on a cycle-by-cycle basis. This monitoring is accomplished through the following components within the RA Application: controls, dashboards, and quarterly reports.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-4__p__Toc212456300">f. PCOLS automatically un-provisions, or removes users from their PCOLS roles in EMMA when their retirements or separations are reported to the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS). DEERS receives personnel information updates from the DoD services and agencies on a regular basis.</p>
      <p class="p" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-4__qsZVHx">g. As discussed in Section 2-2, PCOLS users are responsible for completing DAU GLG005, Purchase Card Online System (PCOLS) prior to GPC appointment and GPC account issuance. DAU GL 005 provides comprehensive role-based PCOLS training and assists in understanding how to utilize the preceding applications in providing oversight of your GPC Program.</p>

The request to override a merchant’s blocked MCC must be prepared by the BO of the CH who wants to make the purchase. The request must contain the name and masked account number (show only the last 10 digits of the account number) of the CH, a description of the item(s) to be purchased, the merchant’s exact name and address, the MCC that must be overridden, the estimated dollar amount of the purchase, the estimated date of the purchase, and a description of efforts to locate a source other than the merchant with the blocked MCC. In addition, the request must specify the need for the particular requirement (for example, a special magnifying glass, available only from a jewelry store, needed to examine circuit card wiring). The request is routed through the appropriate Level 4 A/OPC to the Level 3 A/OPC for approval. Approvals are granted on a transaction-by-transaction basis. This process does not allow recurring purchases from a restricted merchant. If the request is approved, the Level 4 A/OPC contacts the Servicing Bank to have the specific transaction approved from the restricted merchant. The CH has five days to make the purchase.

Accountable property includes all property purchased, leased (capital leases), or otherwise obtained having a unit acquisition cost of $5,000 or more (land, regardless of cost), and items that are sensitive. Sensitive items require a high degree of protection and control due to statutory requirements or regulations, such as narcotics and drug abuse items; precious metals; items which are of a high value, highly technical, or a hazardous nature; and small arms, ammunition, explosives, and demolition material or classified (See Volume 10, Table 61 of DOD 4100.39-M reference (k)). Additional and/or separate records or other record keeping instruments shall be established for management purposes, or when otherwise required by law, policy, regulation, or agency direction, including, but not limited to pilferable items. Pilferable items have a ready resale value or application to personal possession and are, therefore, especially subject to theft. Screening by the Property Book Officer (PBO) is required to determine the accounting requirements of the purchased property. The installation PBO provides guidance on specific local property accountability procedures to the A/OPC, BOs, and CHs related to GPC purchases.</p>
