A merchant that has been blocked may still sell items that are authorized for purchase with the GPC. If a CH determines that he or she must make a purchase from a source that has been blocked because of its assigned MCC, the following procedures apply. The request to override a merchant’s blocked MCC must be prepared by the BO of the CH who wants to make the purchase. The request must contain the name and masked account number (show only the last 10 digits of the account number) of the CH, a description of the item(s) to be purchased, the merchant’s exact name and address, the MCC that must be overridden, the estimated dollar amount of the purchase, the estimated date of the purchase, and a description of efforts to locate a source other than the merchant with the blocked MCC. In addition, the request must specify the need for the particular requirement (for example, a special magnifying glass, available only from a jewelry store, needed to examine circuit card wiring). The request is routed through the appropriate Level 4 A/OPC to the Level 3 A/OPC for approval. Approvals are granted on a transaction-by-transaction basis. This process does not allow recurring purchases from a restricted merchant. If the request is approved, the Level 4 A/OPC contacts the Servicing Bank to have the specific transaction approved from the restricted merchant. The CH has five days to make the purchase.
