   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. Span of control refers to the extent of oversight and review
responsibilities placed on a single A/OPC, BO, or CH. An appropriate span of
control must efficiently and effectively allow the A/OPC, BO, or CH to provide
reasonable assurance they can effectively perform their responsibilities
regardless of the number of accounts assigned. The assigned span of control must
factor in the monitoring and oversight responsibilities to include the use of
MasterCard’s Insights on Demand (IOD) data mining and review process.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. The Army standard for span of control for a Level 4 A/OPC will not be more
than 250 total accounts to one Level 4 A/OPC. This number includes both BO and
CH accounts. Span of control updates are deemed necessary due to changing
program dynamics and increased oversight burdens placed on GPC oversight
personnel over time. As the micro-purchase threshold has increased multiple
times over the years, additional oversight has been required as the average
dollar value and the types and complexity of the GPC supplies and services being
purchased has increased. A/OPCs and other GPC oversight officials have also been
required to fulfill additional duties related to statutory and regulatory DoD
Charge Card Guidebook, FAR, and DFARS requirements, including complying with
Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 NDAA Section 889(a)(1) requirements. These dynamics
warranted a reduction in the number of GPC accounts an A/OPC is authorized to
oversee, and the flexibility for Component Program Managers to deviate from
updated span of control ratios when sufficient compensating controls are in
place.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. A ratio of not more than seven card accounts to a primary BO is the Army
standard. Ensuring a reasonable number of card accounts are assigned to each
primary BO is paramount to the effective accomplishment of the BO’s
responsibilities. The total number of transactions, as well as the number of
assigned card accounts, must be considered when determining an acceptable card
account to BO ratio.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. When the number of accounts (250:1 account per A/OPC) or workload
complexity/administration assigned to a Level 4 A/OPC exceeds the Army standard,
the SCO and the CCO must ensure adequate resources are made available to allow
the A/OPCs to successfully perform their duties. When the span of control
exceeds the Army standard and the CCO elects not to provide additional
resources, the CCO must submit a waiver request in writing to the CPM for
approval. The waiver request must include the rationale and justification upon
which the CCO has based the determination that the existing span of control is
adequate to ensure program administration and that surveillance can be performed
at a satisfactory level given the existing or new compensatory controls put in
place. The Level 3 A/OPC must retain a copy of this documentation.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. The Level 4 A/OPC determines whether the BO to CH ratio is acceptable upon
issuance of a GPC, during the A/OPC’s annual assessment of their GPC program, or
as needed. There must be a reasonable expectation that the BO can complete a
thorough review of all transactions and certify the invoice within five business
days of its receipt. When the ratio for CH accounts to BO exceeds the Army
standard, the BO should lower the number of card accounts or request a waiver to
policy. The Level 4 A/OPC will document all cases where the CH to BO ratio
exceeds the Army standard. The waiver to policy request must address the unique
conditions that affect the process and show, with a high degree of certainty,
that the BO can be expected to comply with the review and certification
procedures. The request must include the number and location of assigned CHs,
the total average number of transactions made by the CHs, the amount of time the
BO can devote to the certification process, the history of delinquencies, and
other appropriate factors. The waiver is approved at the following levels
indicated below and maintained by the approver with copies furnished to the
BO:</p>
      <p class="p">1) 8–10 card accounts. Routed through the Level 4 A/OPC to the CCO.</p>
      <p class="p">2) 11–19 card accounts. Routed through the A/OPCs (Level 4 and Level 3) to
the SCO.</p>
      <p class="p">3) 20 or more card accounts. Routed through the A/OPCs (Level 4 and Level 3)
to the Level 2.</p>
