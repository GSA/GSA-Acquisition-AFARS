DoD’s authorized and required training obligating document.
Each student should complete an SF 182 or equivalent. Organizations
must not identify multiple individuals under Section A –
Trainee Information (i.e., no bulk SF 182s). The SF 182 is used to
approve training or education courses, conventions, conferences,
symposiums, meetings, workshops, and other events if the primary
reason for the activity is to train or develop the attendee to meet
mission needs. The SF 182 may not be used to procure general
supplies, training equipment, or non-training services. See OPM.gov

the session/event already exists. All applicable event details
(e.g., date, time, location) are known and advertised to the
public. The cardholder is paying for slot(s) in the existing

authorized by use of a single SF 182 is $25,000 per transaction.
Paying for individual slot(s) in an existing course is not a
FAR-based transaction. As such, the MPT does not apply to these
transactions. </p>

        <p class="p List2">3) The GPC is being used to pay the training

reimburse the employee (DoD FMR Volume 10, Chapter 12, Section

cannot divide the total cost by 150 to arrive at a price per

applied to the aggregate cost, i.e., $30,000. Because the total
cost exceeds the MPT, the GPC cannot be used as the purchasing
method.  The request must be procured by a contract
action.  If desired, GPC may be used as the payment mechanism
on the contract. </p>

Academic degree training requests, regardless of funding source
(career program or command), require approval by the Assistant
Secretary of the Army (Manpower and Reserve Affairs) (ASA
(M&amp;RA)). This does not apply to employees in Army-sponsored
Intern or Fellows programs. Employees must not circumvent the
academic degree training approval and funding process by submitting
requests for the approval of individual college courses, annotating
that such training is not part of an academic degree training
program.</p>
