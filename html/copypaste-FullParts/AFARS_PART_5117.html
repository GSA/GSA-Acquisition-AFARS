      <p class="p Revised August 4, 2022">A Job Order Contract (JOC) is an indefinite-delivery,
         indefinite-quantity contract and an alternative contracting method to fulfill repair,
         maintenance, and minor construction requirements on a variety of projects ranging from
         sustainment, restoration, and modernization, simplified acquisition of base repair
         requirements, civil works operations and maintenance, small renovations, real property
         repair and maintenance with an estimated value more than the micro-purchase threshold for
         acquisitions of construction. A JOC includes a comprehensive collection of detailed repair,
         maintenance, and minor construction task descriptions or specifications, units of measure,
         and pre-established unit prices for discrete tasks. Each JOC order is comprised of several
         pre-described and pre-priced tasks. In general, proposed projects valued at or below the
         micro-purchase threshold for acquisitions of construction are considered inappropriate for
         ordering under a JOC because of the administrative costs associated with processing JOC
         orders and the simplified purchase methods available for these actions.</p>

      <p class="p">As used in this subpart –</p>
      <p class="p Revised August 4, 2022 List1">“JOC Price Book” (JOCPB) means the
         compilation of repair, maintenance, and minor construction tasks, associated units of
         measure and unit prices that are used in job order solicitations and a JOC. JOC unit prices
         include direct material, labor and equipment costs, but not indirect costs or profits which
         are addressed in the coefficient(s). The use of labor-only line items is appropriate for
         use when proper internal controls are in place and incidental to construction. Labor line
         items are not to provide services, typically performed under a separate service or
         requirements contract. The JOCPB reflects the current local costs in detail for
         construction tasks expected to be performed in the geographical area of the base contract

         what additional types of costs are included in their coefficients in their proposal. These
         additional costs may be incorporated in the contract, if appropriate, and may preclude

         properly prepare a responsive and cost-effective proposal with a minimum of non-pre-priced

         line items in an attempt to circumvent the limitation in (c)(2).</p>
