Evidence of deliberate abuse shall be referred to the CH’s and/or BO’s Commander by the CCO for appropriate action in accordance with the Uniform Code of Military Justice or civilian disciplinary rules. Evidence of fraud or other criminal activity shall be referred, by the Commander/CCO, to the appropriate investigative body (e.g. Office of the Inspector General (OIG), Army Audit Agency (AAA)) or other investigative body for a follow up investigation.  The violation and action taken shall be documented in the A/OPC’s files.</p></conbody></concept>
