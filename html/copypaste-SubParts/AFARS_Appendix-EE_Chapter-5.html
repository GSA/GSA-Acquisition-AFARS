      <span class="ph autonumber">5-1.</span> Nomination, Selection, and Appointment of Cardholders and
        Billing Officials</h2>
    <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. Nomination, selection, and appointment of BOs and CHs are in
            accordance with DOD Charge Card Guidebook Chapters A.1.1 and A.3.
            A/OPCs must receive written and signed approval from the BO/CH’s
            supervisory chain of command before initiating their appointment
            process. BOs must successfully complete the required GPC training to
            be appointed as an Approving/Billing Official. BOs should be in the
            supervisory chain of command of the CH. The BO will not be
            subordinate in grade or rank to their CHs to mitigate undue
            influence. There are no exceptions to this policy.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. CHs must successfully complete the required GPC training to be
            delegated procurement authority <strong class="ph b">prior</strong> to receiving their
            card.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. The BO is also a Certifying Officer within the context of the Army
            GPC program, except for pay and confirm proponents. The Certifying
            Officer’s minimum qualifications and eligibility are further
            discussed in DoD FMR Volume 5, Chapter 33. Billing officials are
            responsible for the accuracy of payments, including designation of
            the proper appropriation(s) or other funds certified to the paying
            office and disbursing officer. BOs are financially responsible for
            any illegal, improper, or incorrect payment as a result of an
            inaccurate or misleading certification. To certify GPC invoices for
            payment by DFAS, the BO must be appointed as and accept the
            responsibilities of a Certifying Officer using the DD Form 577
            generated in JAM.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. Approving Officials (AOs) follow pay and confirm procedures and
            are not appointed as Certifying Officers, such as Air Force
            personnel under the Army program.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. GPC Delegation of Authority and appointment letters will clearly
            state the duties of the program participant, any dollar limit of the
            procurement authority (when applicable), and any limitations on the
            scope of authority to be exercised other than those contained in
            applicable law or regulation. All delegates/appointees must
            countersign their letters electronically in JAM to acknowledge they
            understand and concur with their GPC program responsibilities prior
            to establishing any accounts in the bank’s EAS.</p>
        <p class="p List1">f. A/OPCs will maintain and monitor all delegations, appointments
            letters, and training certificates electronically in JAM. If
            electronic versions are available, the Level 4 A/OPC is not required
            to maintain a hard copy. Audit agencies can request access to PIEE
            modules when required. Ensure military and civilian out-processing
            checklists include a mandatory A/OPC sign-off for BOs and CHs. </p>
        <p class="p List1">g. <strong class="ph b">Receiving a GPC</strong>. Standard practice is to have the card
            mailed to the CH’s work address in accordance with the GSA
            SmartPay®3 contract. Using a CH’s home address may be a fraud
            indicator and should not be a normal practice. However, there are
            situations where an alternate address, including the CH’s home
            address, may be valid. Whether the card is mailed to the CH’s work
            address or an alternate address, the CH must maintain the physical
            security of the card. Examples of alternate address uses include,
            but are not limited to, the following:</p>
        <p class="p">1) When an A/OPC wants all cards mailed to the A/OPC’s work address,
            and then the A/OPC provides each card to the new CH’s work
            location.</p>
        <p class="p">2) When the A/OPC feels it is more reliable to have the card mailed
            to the A/OPC’s work address and then sent by express mail to a CH’s
            work address overseas.</p>
        <p class="p">3) When the organization has a policy that all cards will be sent to
            the work address of the responsible BO, who will then deliver each
            card to the CH in person or to the CH’s work address.</p>
        <p class="p">4) When the CH will not be at the work location (duty station) for an
            extended period (COVID-19 stay-at-home orders would be one such
            example), the CH’s home address could be used. If the CH’s home
            address is used for card delivery, a note or memorandum for record
            must be added to the account notes stating why the home address was
            used.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. GPCs are issued only as mission requirements dictate. Only DoD civilian
employees or members of the Armed Forces may be issued a GPC or be appointed a
BO. GPCs may not be issued to contractor personnel, except as provided in
paragraph 1-5d. Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC) instructors,
Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) local national employees of the Army,
and host Government direct hires for OCONUS agencies/organizations whose
salaries are reimbursed by the Army or DoD tenant organizations, are not
considered DoD contractors, and may be designated as CHs and BOs. Traditional
National Guard members and State employees are prohibited from being appointed
as a CH, BO or A/OPC. The following types of purchases require a separate card
account delegated solely for that purpose:</p>
      <p class="p">1) Contract Payments</p>
      <p class="p">2) Official Representation Funds (ORF)</p>
      <p class="p">3) Ammunition</p>
      <p class="p">4) Gift Fund (for donated or proffered monies)</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Card Account Limits</strong>. Each card account has a single purchase limit
and a cycle or monthly limit. In most cases, the single purchase limit is the
micro-purchase threshold. The cycle limit is determined by the anticipated
spending needs of the cardholder.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Managing Account Limits</strong>. Each managing account has a cycle limit
and a credit limit. The cycle limit is the sum of the monthly limits of all
cardholders under the managing account. The credit limit is three times the
managing account’s cycle limit.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Establishing Credit Limits</strong>. The requiring activity establishes the
credit limit, based on the organization and the user’s anticipated spending
needs. The limits should be set at a level commensurate with historical
spending, anticipated requirements, and available funding. Limits should not be
based on unlikely contingencies. The A/OPC approves requested limits and inputs
the single purchase limit when creating the card account. The A/OPC then
communicates the credit limits to the RM, who inputs the CH’s credit limit and
the BO’s cycle and credit limit. RMs also establish the default and alternate
lines of accounting for the proper designation of appropriation.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Updating Credit Limits</strong>. The single purchase, cycle, and credit
limits can be changed as necessary to meet operational needs. The A/OPC inputs
changes to the single purchase limit. The RM inputs cycle and credit limit
changes. RMs must notify the Level 4 A/OPC of any cycle or credit limit changes
to a BO or CH account.</p>

      <p class="p List1">a. Only cardholders with a continuing need to use the GPC will retain their
card and appointment. At least 60 calendar days prior to reassignment,
separation, or retirement, the CH or BO should notify the A/OPC of their change
in status and begin to transition their duties and files over to another
appointed organization representative. The BO must advise the Level 4 A/OPC when
a CH no longer has a continuing need to use the card or when the CH transfers to
other duties or organizations, retires, or leaves Government service.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. The Level 4 A/OPC will terminate the CH’s or BO’s appointment in JAM and
close the account in the servicing bank. The physical card must be destroyed,
and its destruction must be confirmed in writing. When a cardholder account is
terminated or closed, the cardholder will surrender the GPC and submit the
account documentation to the BO. The BO will perform an in-depth surveillance of
the cardholder’s records within 30 calendar days of termination or closure.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. The BO will ensure all outstanding transactions (charges and/or credits)
have cleared the bank and the card has been destroyed. When a BO vacates their
assignment, and a new BO is assigned, all CH accounts remain active under the
existing managing account. The departing BO must reconcile their account with
Financial Management prior to vacating the position. When a BO requests
termination of their managing account, all CHs will surrender their GPC and
submit the account documentation to the BO. The BO will perform an in-depth
surveillance of the CH’s records within 30 calendar days of termination. When
all transactions (charges and/or credits) have cleared the bank and the card(s)
has been destroyed, the BO will process removal of the remaining funds and
submit a request for account termination to the A/OPC.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">5-5.</span> Liability of Cardholders and Billing Officials</h2>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_5-5__Toc101163526">a. <strong class="ph b">Liability</strong>. Billing officials are personally and
pecuniarily liable for the full amount of any improper payments resulting from
misuse, abuse, or unauthorized purchases of the GPC, in accordance with 31 USC
3528. Strict pecuniary liability applies when there is an erroneous (illegal,
improper, or incorrect) payment. GPC CHs are pecuniarily liable for erroneous
payments that result from the negligent performance of duties, up to one month’s
pay. All accountable officials are required to comply with DoD regulations,
policies, and procedures, including standard operating procedures. Failure to
act in accordance with such regulations, policies, and procedures is generally
considered evidence of negligence. Following orders from superiors that are
contrary to regulations, policies, and procedures, is no defense to negligence
or bad faith. A heavy workload or a lack of experience, supervision, or
training, is not a factor in determining relief from liability.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_5-5__Toc101163528">b. Use of the GPC by a CH to make an unauthorized purchase is
the liability of the Government. However, the installation/organization is
responsible for taking appropriate action against the CH including efforts to
recover the funds.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. The intentional use of the GPC for other than official Government business
may be considered an attempt to commit fraud against the U.S. Government. Misuse
may result in immediate cancellation of an individual's card, financial
liability, and negative administrative and/or disciplinary action against the CH
and, if warranted, against the BO. Any misuse of the GPC is subject to criminal,
civil, Uniform Code of Military Justice, administrative, and disciplinary
actions as appropriate.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Cardholders</strong>. DoD FMR Volume 5, Chapter 5, paragraph 1.1.2 defines a
CH as a Departmental Accountable Official (DAO). DAOs are accountable officials
that provide information, data, or services that certifying officers rely on to
certify vouchers. DoD Directive 7000.14-R imposes financial liability for
negligent performance of the CH’s duties. DAOs will be personally and
pecuniarily liable for erroneous payments that result from the negligent
performance of duties.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Billing Officials</strong>. 31 USC 3528 provides for personal and pecuniary
liability for improper payments resulting from misuse/abuse of the purchase card
for Certifying Officials. The BO meets the definition for Certifying Officer in
the DoD FMR; as such, the BO is financially liable for improper payments
resulting from misuse or abuse. The act of certifying a billing statement for
payment makes the BO financially responsible for illegal, improper, or incorrect
payment due to an inaccurate or misleading certification. Consequently, a BO who
knowingly makes a false certification may be asked to repay the Government for
the items or service purchased. If unsure about certification, BOs should
contact the supporting Level 4 A/OPC for guidance.</p>
      <p class="p List1">f. <strong class="ph b">SCO Oversight</strong>. The SCO and/or CCO have responsibility for the
operation of the GPC program for their activity. The SCO is responsible for
establishing effective internal controls that will ensure the appropriate
management, operation, and oversight of the local GPC program. The SCO must
establish and maintain a command climate to prevent the requiring activity from
exercising undue influence over the actions of a cardholder. The SCO will
establish local policies and procedures identifying informal and formal
disciplinary actions to be taken in the event of noncompliance, fraud, misuse,
and abuse. Disciplinary actions should be based on the severity and frequency of
the infraction and can range from informal actions (such as written or verbal
counseling) to demotion, removal, or potential criminal prosecution.</p>
      <p class="p List1">g. <strong class="ph b">Investigation Required</strong>. Commands must be notified when evidence of
fraud or other criminal activity is identified. Evidence of deliberate abuse
will be referred to the CH’s and/or BO’s command for appropriate action. The
investigation must provide the Army employee or military member with an
opportunity to rebut the presumed liability.

    <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. Level 3 and 4 A/OPCs have the authority to suspend BO and CH
            accounts due to non-compliance with GPC policies and procedures.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Automatic Suspensions</strong>. Requests for suspension exemptions
            for BO accounts with operational emergencies may be granted on a
            case-by-case basis. Exemption requests must be submitted in writing
            from the Level 4 A/OPC, through the Level 3, to the Level 2 point of
            contact. In accordance with DoD business practices, U.S. Bank will
            automatically suspend BO accounts under the following
            conditions:</p>
        <p class="p">1) BO’s account goes over 60 days past due (90 days after the billing
            date). The managing account and all card accounts under it are
            suspended until the delinquent payment has posted.</p>
        <p class="p">2) BO’s account goes over 180 days past due (210 days after the
            billing date). All managing accounts assigned under the Level 4
            agent are suspended until delinquent payment has posted. The
            delinquent managing account is permanently closed (T9).</p>
        <p class="p">3) BO’s account has more than 20 open card and/or checking accounts.
            The managing account is suspended unless a waiver has been approved
            by the Army Level 2 A/OPC.</p>
        <p class="p">4) Before reopening a closed account due to a delinquent payment, the
            Level 3 and/or 4 A/OPC will document that U.S. Bank received full
            payment. Only the Army Level 2 may reopen suspended accounts prior
            to payment being received by U.S. Bank. Accounts will be closed
            permanently if more than two suspensions occur within a 12-month
            period. Only the Army Level 2 A/OPC may approve waivers to this
            policy.</p>

    <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. CHs are responsible for properly using and safeguarding their GPC.
            CHs must take appropriate precautions comparable to those taken to
            secure personal checks, credit cards, or cash. CHs must maintain the
            physical security of the card to prevent compromise. The card should
            never be surrendered, except when the account is going to be
            cancelled. Additionally, the account number should not be released
            to anyone other than the vendor processing the transaction.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Lost or stolen cards</strong>. The CH must promptly report lost,
            stolen, or compromised cards to the issuing bank, BO, and Level 4
            A/OPC. The servicing bank will immediately block the account from
            accepting additional charges.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. Only the designated CH has authority to make purchases with their
            GPC. The card is not to be used as a company card (e.g., during a
            CH’s absence, someone other than the CH borrows the card to make a
            purchase). Use of a GPC by multiple persons is prohibited.</p>
        <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_5-7__Toc532909305">d. In addition to corrective or disciplinary
            action, military personnel who misuse their GPC may have their
            access to classified information modified or revoked if warranted in
            the interest of national security. Commanders and supervisors will
            follow Army guidance to ensure that security clearance reviews are
            conducted if the CH comes under investigation for card misuse.</p>
