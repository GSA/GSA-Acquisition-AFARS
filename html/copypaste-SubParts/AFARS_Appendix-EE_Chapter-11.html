   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. DoD Instruction 5010.40, “Managers’ Internal Control Program Procedures,”
30 May 2013, requires DoD organizations to implement a comprehensive system of
internal controls providing reasonable assurance that programs are operating as
intended and to evaluate the effectiveness of the controls. Management and
program oversight is conducted to achieve the following goals:</p>
      <p class="p">1) Validate and promote compliance with existing purchasing and management
internal controls.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Identify, report, and resolve systemic material program weaknesses.</p>
      <p class="p">3) Measure the effectiveness of purchasing and management internal
controls.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. GPC management oversight controls are tools and activities that are used
to identify, report, and address fraud, waste, and abuse. The Army GPC Program
fully implements guidance and direction addressed in the April 18, 2019, OUSD
Memorandum, “DoD SmartPay® 3 Government-wide Commercial Purchase Card policies,
Procedures and Tools – SP3 Transition Memorandum #6.”</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Data analytics.</strong> Data analytics is the application of electronic
tools (software and/or systems) for automated data sorting, filtering and mining
techniques using self-learning algorithms to search GPC transaction data in
order to identify patterns, trends, risks, opportunities and other information.
Data analytics and reporting tools are available as part of the GSA SmartPay® 3
Government-wide charge card program. Agencies have the ability to monitor their
account transactions to identify any unusual spending patterns or frequency of
transactions. Agency data analytics, in addition to the data analytics
techniques already used by the banks to monitor account transactions, provide a
multi-layered approach to help identify suspected fraud, misuse and delinquency.
Data analytics can also be used to identify opportunities for expanded card use
and associated benefits for the Army. A/OPCs should use data analytics tools to
assist them in the management and oversight of their GPC program.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. The Army uses preventive, detective, and directive controls to monitor the
GPC program.</p>
      <p class="p">1) Preventive controls are designed to discourage errors or irregularities
from occurring (e.g., processing a transaction only after it has been properly
approved by the appropriate personnel).</p>
      <p class="p">2) Detective controls are designed to find errors or irregularities after
they have occurred (e.g., IOD data mining, approving statements, and reconciling
monthly invoices).</p>
      <p class="p">3) Directive controls are designed to encourage a desirable event (e.g.,
written policies and procedures to assist in compliance and the accomplishment
of the goals and objectives of the GPC program).</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. Understanding internal controls
assists GPC participants in their stewardship role in achieving GPC program
objectives. Internal control is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the achievement of objectives in the following categories:
effectiveness and efficiency of operations, reliability of financial reporting,
and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. This
understanding provides an additional
reference tool for all GPC participants to identify and assess operating
controls, financial reporting, and legal/regulatory compliance processes and to
take action to strengthen controls where needed. Over time, controls may be
expected to change to reflect changes in the operating environment. In order to
achieve a balance between risk and controls, internal
controls should address exposure to risk and be proactive, value-added, and
cost-effective.</p>
      <p class="p List1">f. Identifying Fraudulent, Improper and Abusive Purchases. Designing and
conducting procedures specifically for the purpose of detecting such
transactions (e.g., IOD data mining) serves multiple purposes, including the
potential discovery of a previously unrecognized risk in the program. Repeated
non-adherence to established internal control policies and procedures, such as
inadequate documentation of purchase card transactions or supervisory reviews,
if allowed to continue, would contribute to erosion and weakening of the GPC
internal control system. Prompt administrative and disciplinary actions can be
effective in reducing persistent lack of adherence to policies and procedures by
CHs and other program officials.</p>
      <p class="p List1">g. The SCO and A/OPCs are responsible for adhering to the requirements
specified in OMB Circular A-123, Management’s Responsibility for Internal
Control. This circular provides guidance on improving the accountability and
effectiveness of GPC programs and operations by establishing, assessing,
correcting, and reporting on internal control, as well as prescribing policies
and procedures to agencies regarding how to maintain internal controls that
reduce the risk of fraud, waste, and error in GPC programs.</p>
      <p class="p List1">h. The SCO and A/OPCs are also responsible for adhering to the requirements
specified in 10 USC 4754 (as modified by Public Law 112–194, Government Charge
Card Abuse Prevention Act of 2012). These statutory requirements mandate the
following actions (list not comprehensive):</p>
      <p class="p">1) Using effective systems, techniques, and technologies to prevent or
identify improper purchases.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Invalidating GPCs from each employee who ceases to be employed by the
Government or separates from Military Service.</p>
      <p class="p">3) Taking steps to recover the cost of any illegal, improper, or erroneous
purchases made with a purchase card or convenience check made by an employee or
member of the armed forces, including, as necessary, through salary offsets.</p>
      <p class="p">4) Taking appropriate adverse personnel actions or imposing other punishments
when employees of the Army violate regulations governing the use and control of
purchase cards and convenience checks or who are negligent or engage in misuse,
abuse, or fraud with respect to a purchase card, including removal in
appropriate cases. Violations of such regulations by a person subject to 10 USC
Chapter 47, the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), is punishable as a
violation of section 892 of article 92 of the UCMJ.</p>
      <p class="p">5) Requiring the Army Audit Agency to conduct periodic audits or reviews of
GPC programs to identify and analyze risks of illegal, improper, or erroneous
purchases and payments and report the result to the Director of the OMB and
Congress.</p>
      <p class="p List1">i. A/OPCs must provide monitoring, oversight, training, and administration of
all BOs and CHs. Supervisors and BOs are responsible for the monitoring and
oversight of BOs and CHs under their purview.</p>
      <p class="p List1">j. To minimize losses to the Army, the program must have an expectation of
high integrity and ethical behavior from all participants, and sufficient staff
to perform the following functions:</p>
      <p class="p">1) Conduct periodic risk assessments to identify fraud, waste, and abuse and
establish specific controls to reasonably ensure that losses from these risks
are minimized, to include data mining.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Conduct proper training and complete reporting and data analysis to ensure
personnel have the skills and information needed to be effective in their
positions.</p>
      <p class="p">3) Conduct detailed, effective management and oversight.</p>
      <p class="p">4) Implement corrective actions when cardholder management is non-compliant
with Army policies and procedures.</p>
      <p class="p List1">k. Monitoring and oversight of the GPC is a shared responsibility. All
stakeholders in the program, including Resource and Financial Managers,
logistics, contracting, and local audit and oversight organizations, are
responsible for ensuring that the GPC is used in the proper manner and only
authorized and necessary official purchases are made. Organizations should
develop and follow a monitoring and oversight plan that establishes frequencies,
methods, participation, etc., on how their monitoring/oversight programs will
operate.</p>
      <p class="p List1">l. DPC issued several SP3 Transition Memorandums on GPC monitoring and
oversight. DPC will rely on the signed Semi-Annual HA data provided by CPMs to
accomplish DoD GPC reporting required by OMB. DPC updates visual trending of
statistical and violation information to identify trends in GPC use and
variances and shares this information with the Army during the GPC CPM Monthly
Calls.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_11-1__Hlk118374461">m. The GPC Integrated Solutions Team (IST) is DoD’s GPC
governance body. IST membership consists of a GPC Governance Board composed of
representatives from DPC, Army, Navy, Air Force, other Defense agencies, and
supported by the bank team. The bank team consists of U.S. Bank (card-issuing
bank), MasterCard (card association), and Oversight Systems (data mining
vendor). The IST typically meets semi-annually to achieve the following:</p>
      <p class="p">1) Review trends and changes in the GPC industry and the DoD GPC Program.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Identify and approve any necessary adjustments to the bank team's
electronic capabilities, DoD’s GPC enterprise tools, and/or DoD GPC
policies.</p>
      <p class="p">3) Identify and approve changes to the DM rules and system parameter
settings.</p>
      <p class="p">4) Bring efficiencies to the Program by adjusting the business
rules/parameters based on transaction risk.</p>
      <p class="p">5) Review trends and changes in the GPC industry and the DoD GPC Program.</p>
      <p class="p">6) Identify any necessary adjustments to the bank team's electronic
capabilities, DoD’s GPC enterprise tools, and/or DoD GPC policies.</p>
      <p class="p">7) Identify and approving changes to the Data Mining rules.</p>
      <p class="p">8) Review relevant data mining case information and recommendations provided
by the bank team (e.g., percentage of data mining cases created for review;
frequency with which each rule is triggered and associated DM case disposition,
and information about the findings, determinations, and corrective actions
identified) and results of the Semi-Annual HA process to inform its decision
making.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">11-2.</span> Internal Management Controls</h2>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. Management officials are responsible for establishing a system of internal
controls that provides reasonable assurance that the GPC program is efficiently,
effectively, and legally achieving its purpose and complies with applicable laws
and regulations.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. Required internal management controls include the following:</p>
      <p class="p">1) <strong class="ph b">Management Controls</strong>. GPC programs will evaluate the expected
benefits and related costs of internal control activities.</p>
      <p class="p">2) <strong class="ph b">Training</strong>. All GPC program participants will receive appropriate
role-based training.</p>
      <p class="p">3) <strong class="ph b">Delegation of Authority</strong>. GPC programs will clearly document
Delegations of Procurement Authority beginning with a DFARS-designated
Contracting Activity (DFARS PGI 202.101) down to each CH. Each program
participant will receive and sign the delegation and appointment documents
(e.g., Delegation of Procurement Authority letters, appointment letters, and DD
Form 577) required for their role.</p>
      <p class="p">4) <strong class="ph b">System Functional Responsibility Controls</strong>. Electronic systems used
to support the DoD GPC program will segregate role-based capabilities and limit
access to functions to only individuals with appropriate authority. The system
will be able to identify who made any data/file content changes in the
end-to-end GPC process.</p>
      <p class="p">5) <strong class="ph b">System Access Security</strong>. Appropriate safeguards will be in place to
control issuance of user IDs and access credentials to the EAS.</p>
      <p class="p">6) <strong class="ph b">CH Account Initiation</strong>. Only personnel in the CH's supervisory chain
are authorized to request the opening of a new CH account. This request must
identify appropriate card parameters.</p>
      <p class="p">7) <strong class="ph b">Authorization Controls</strong>. Appropriate spending limits, budget (i.e.,
credit) limits, and MCC access will be established and tailored to each CH
account. Spending limits and MCC access should reflect historical buying
patterns/ trends.</p>
      <p class="p">8) <strong class="ph b">Purchase Log</strong>. All CHs maintain a purchase log on the servicing
bank’s EAS unless a waiver is granted and signed by Army. If a waiver is
granted, CHs will document purchase information for each GPC transaction in an
electronic log in the automated system where the individual card transactions
and billing statements are approved and certified for payment.</p>
      <p class="p">9) <strong class="ph b">Maintain Positive System of Funds Control</strong>. Spending limits (such as
single purchase and credit limits) are tied directly to the funding allocated
for each card account (monthly, quarterly, and semiannually). Limits should be
consistent with historical spending patterns to minimize Government exposure and
ensure adequate funds availability. This control helps ensure that funding is
available prior to purchases being made with the GPC.</p>
      <p class="p">10) <strong class="ph b">Ensure Separation of Duties</strong>. Key duties must be assigned to
different individuals to the greatest extent possible to minimize the risk of
loss to the Government. Examples of key duties include making purchases (CH),
authorizing payments (BO), certifying funding (Resource Managers), and reviewing
and auditing purchase activity (A/OPC).</p>
      <p class="p">11) <strong class="ph b">Span of Control</strong>. To ensure GPC program participants have
sufficient time to complete required reviews, GPC programs will abide by
established span of control limits.</p>
      <p class="p">12) <strong class="ph b">Reconcile and Approve the CH Statement</strong>. During each billing cycle,
CHs are required to match orders and reconcile the statement they receive from
the issuing bank against the purchase card log in the bank’s EAS.</p>
      <p class="p">13) <strong class="ph b">Reconcile and Certify the Managing Account Statement</strong>. After the CH
has approved the statement, the BO must approve or reject each purchase made by
CHs in the BO’s managing account. When the BO has reviewed each invoice, the BO,
acting in the role of Certifying Officer, certifies the entire invoice as legal,
proper, and correct. A/OPCs must track managing account certification after the
end of the billing cycle.</p>
      <p class="p">14) <strong class="ph b">Exercise Dispute Authority</strong>. Cardholders have 90 days from the date
the transaction posted to the account to dispute the transaction, when
needed.</p>
      <p class="p">15) <strong class="ph b">Maintain Authorization Controls</strong>. A/OPCs must add the appropriate
MCC filters to each CH account.</p>
      <p class="p">16) <strong class="ph b">Ensure Systems Access Security</strong>. Appropriate safeguards must be in
place to control issuance and safeguarding of access credentials to the EAS.</p>
      <p class="p">17) <strong class="ph b">Ensure Available Funding Integrity</strong>. Certified LOAs must be
traceable through disbursement. All changes to LOAs must be documented and
certified.</p>
      <p class="p">18) <strong class="ph b">Ensure Invoice Integrity</strong>. An electronic certification process
ensures the original electronic invoice is traceable from the vendor through the
certification and entitlement processes and retained in a Government record.
Should the original invoice submitted by the contractor be in paper form, the
Certifying Officer will determine if the invoice is proper for payment and affix
his/her signature in accordance with the governing provisions of the DoD FMR. If
appropriate, the Certifying Officer makes any required “pen and ink” changes on
the original invoice to reallocate the payment to different funding lines from
those reflected on the original invoice. The Certifying Officer determines
whether these changes are proper and affix his/her signature with the standard
certification language on the original paper invoice.</p>
      <p class="p">19) <strong class="ph b">System Administration Integrity/Data Exchange/Transaction
Security</strong>. Changes to the operating system environment will be documented in
accordance with the DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation
(DIACAP) process.</p>
      <p class="p">20) <strong class="ph b">Transaction Data Integrity</strong>. The original transaction/invoice will
be maintained and cannot be altered.</p>
      <p class="p">21) <strong class="ph b">Data Mining</strong>. Implement a data mining capability that reviews all
GPC transactions.</p>
      <p class="p">22) <strong class="ph b">Inactive and Purged Accounts</strong>. A/OPCs must perform an annual review
of the ongoing need for existing card accounts. A/OPCs should terminate accounts
with no activity for more than six months or document the need for the account
to remain open. The servicing bank purges inactive accounts monthly, depending
on the status of the account.</p>
      <p class="p">23) <strong class="ph b">Terminated, Voluntarily Closed, and Fraud Referral status</strong>.
Servicing bank purges the account after 13 months of inactivity.</p>
      <p class="p">24) <strong class="ph b">Open status</strong>. Servicing bank purges the account after 21 months of
inactivity.</p>

      <p class="p List1">a. Insights on Demand (IOD) is the SmartPay®3 data mining (DM) tool used to
monitor purchasing activity and perform oversight functions. IOD provides the
capabilities to identify high-risk transactions and unusual spending patterns;
scan purchasing activity for misuse, fraud, waste, and abuse; and flag
transactions for review. IOD data mining capabilities are used to evaluate 100%
of the Army’s GPC transactions as directed in DoD SmartPay®3 Transition
Memoranda #6 and #12. Instructions on how to navigate and perform functions in
IOD are located in the servicing bank’s IOD user guides and quick references and

Government Charge Card Abuse Prevention Act of 2012) requirement to “use
effective systems, techniques, and technologies to prevent or identify improper
purchases.” It also facilitates transaction reviews and enables documentation of
any findings identified and corrective actions taken. GPC program officials must
use IOD to perform the following actions:</p>
      <p class="p">1) Document Daily DM Case Reviews (includes BO DM Case Questionnaires and
A/OPC DM Case Questionnaires), Monthly A/OPC Reviews (includes Monthly A/OPC
Check List and Monthly A/OPC Review Report) and Semi-Annual Head of Activity

        <p class="p">DM case reviews enable documentation of any identified findings and
            corrective actions taken. DM case reviews include both
            system-generated cases and manually-added cases, which may be opened
            at management’s discretion. Cases must be opened for each finding
            and disciplinary category determination independently identified
            during compliance reviews. Monthly A/OPC Reviews are conducted to
            promote and measure compliance with purchasing and management
            internal controls and provide reasonable assurance of the
            effectiveness of these controls to mitigate program risk.
            Semi-Annual HA Reviews are conducted to ensure adherence to internal
            controls and facilitate senior management’s awareness of their GPC
            program’s health, and to help them promote the interdisciplinary
            communication necessary for successful GPC program operations. The
            use of an automated data mining system enables the Army to fulfill
            the 10 USC 4754 requirement to “use effective systems, techniques,

            IOD DM capability evaluates each transaction against a set of tiered
            business rules to identify high-risk transactions. Tier 1 rules are
            mandatory and applicable to all DoD purchase cards. Tier 2 rules are
            mandatory rules that can be tailored as necessary at the local
            level. DM cases can be system-generated or manually generated. The
            system generates a DM case whenever a business rule is broken. GPC
            program officials are required to manually create cases for each
            finding and disciplinary category determination they independently
            identify during their reviews. Each case is adjudicated to determine
            if the transaction is to be classified under one of five
            disciplinary categories standardized in compliance with the DPC memo
            “Final Governmentwide Commercial Purchase Card Disciplinary Category
            Definitions Guidance,” January 27, 2020. Disputes are also
            categorized as determinations.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Tier 2 Tailoring</strong>. Tier 2 business
            rules are tailorable to the cardholder level to meet the Army’s
            organizational needs. Tailoring must be consistent with requirements
            in the DoD Charge Card Guidebook. As part of the SAHAR process,
            Heads of Activity (HAs) are required to validate that any Tier 2
            Tailoring of DM business rules are implemented appropriately. For
            more information, refer to GPC one-pager 3OP034, “Tier 2 Tailoring
            in Insights on Demand (IOD)” on the DPC GPC website. To properly
            manage program risk for these potentially high-risk transactions,
            IOD automatically selects a random sample of 1% of these Tier 2
            “auto closed” cases and assigns them for adjudication (“1% Random
            Reopen”). The IST reviews Tier 2 Tailoring data sets and trends and

            documentation, inputs detailed comments regarding the purchase,
            identifies the applicable finding, and closes the case in IOD. The
            comments should provide information regarding the transaction and a
            detailed explanation of any findings. For administrative findings,
            the comments must state what documents or signatures were

  <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p">Fraud can be defined as a deception deliberately practiced with the motive of securing unfair or unlawful gain. Fraud can be an attempt to cheat the Federal Government and corrupt its CHs by using GPC accounts for transactions not part of official Government business. Fraud can come in many disguises, such as false emails, mail, or phone calls. The following are the three primary categories of fraud:</p>
      <p class="p">1) <strong class="ph b">Non-cardholder Fraud</strong>. Examples: Lost or stolen card, account takeover, and identity theft.</p>
      <p class="p">2) <strong class="ph b">Cardholder Fraud</strong>. Examples: Kickbacks, falsified transactions, and false statements.</p>
      <p class="p">3) <strong class="ph b">Merchant Fraud</strong>. Examples: False transactions, intentional mischarges, bribes, and gratuities.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">11-8.</span> Non-Cardholder Fraud</h2>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. Non-cardholder fraud involves the use of the card account or CH data by an
unauthorized person. Non-cardholder fraud is investigated by special units
within the servicing bank. Any information acquired relating to non-cardholder
fraud should be reported. The risk of non-cardholder fraud is higher in certain
situations including the following:</p>
      <p class="p">1) <strong class="ph b">Account/Card never received</strong>. A new or replacement card has been
mailed to the account holder but was not received. This may be due to a
third-party interception. In this case, the account should be cancelled, and new
card issued.</p>
      <p class="p">2) <strong class="ph b">Lost or Stolen Account/Card</strong>. If the account holder reports the
account as lost or stolen, the account will be cancelled and new one issued.
Reporting the account as lost or stolen does not relieve the Federal Government
for payment for any transactions that were made by the account holder prior to
losing it. If transactions not made by the account holder appear on the
statement, the account holder has 90 days from the date of the transaction to
file a dispute. If it is not done within 90 days, they may forfeit their rights
to dispute.</p>
      <p class="p">3) <strong class="ph b">Altered or counterfeit cards</strong>. This occurs when third parties obtain
account information and used that information to make purchases with an altered
or counterfeit card. If the banks recognize a fraudulent pattern of use at the
time of authorization, the bank will validate the use of the account with the
account holder and/or suspend the account. If transactions not made by the
account holder appear on the statement, the account holder has 90 days from the
date of the transaction to file a dispute. If it is not done within 90 days,
they may forfeit their rights to dispute.</p>
      <p class="p">4) <strong class="ph b">Account takeover/ Identity theft</strong>. In this case, the account
holder’s identity has been compromised and a third party has requested a new
account by providing confidential information about the account holder. Any
account holder who believes that he or she may have been subject to identity
theft should contact the bank’s customer-service department. Once a
determination is made that an account has been compromised, investigation is the
responsibility of the bank. Unless a Government employee is determined to be
involved in the fraud, the agency generally does not participate in the
investigation. The account will be closed, and a replacement account opened.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Non-Cardholder Fraud Methods</strong>. Some of the different methods of
fraud include the following:</p>
      <p class="p">1) <strong class="ph b">Counterfeit Accounts</strong>. To make fake cards, criminals use the newest
technology to “skim” information contained on magnetic stripes of cards and also
to pass security features (such as holograms).</p>
      <p class="p">2) <strong class="ph b">Lost or Stolen Accounts</strong>. Physical cards are stolen from a
workplace, gym or unattended vehicle.</p>
      <p class="p">3) <strong class="ph b">Card Not Present.</strong> Internet fraud occurs whenever account
information is stolen and used to make online purchases. Merchant asks for the
CVC code (located on the back of the card) to help prevent this type of
fraud.</p>
      <p class="p">4) <strong class="ph b">Phishing</strong>. Phishing occurs whenever a CH receives a fake email
directing him or her to enter sensitive personal information on a phony website.
The false website enables the criminal to steal information from the account
holder.</p>
      <p class="p">5) <strong class="ph b">Non-Receipt</strong>. This type of fraud occurs whenever new or replacement
cards are mailed and then stolen while in transit.</p>
      <p class="p">6) <strong class="ph b">Identity Theft</strong>. A criminal applies for an account using another
person’s identity and information.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Detecting Non-Cardholder Fraud</strong>. One of the first signs that an
individual is a victim of fraud is at least one “mystery expense” showing up in
the monthly statement. To help detect fraud, cardholders should review their
statement by performing the following actions:</p>
      <p class="p">1) Look for transactions you do not recall making.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Check for unknown vendors.</p>
      <p class="p">3) Search for account withdrawals you do not remember making.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Avoiding Non-Cardholder Fraud</strong>. Cardholders should use the following
practices to avoid fraud:</p>
      <p class="p">1) Secure account number and information.</p>
      <p class="p">2) Safeguard your personal identification number (PIN). Do not write it down;
memorize it. Do not share your PIN.</p>
      <p class="p">3) Monitor your card during transactions. When the card is returned, check to
make sure it is yours.</p>
      <p class="p">4) Immediately report lost or stolen accounts and/or any questionable
charges.</p>
      <p class="p">5) Sign the back of a new card as soon as you receive it. If you do not
receive a replacement card before the expiration date of the older card, contact
the bank.</p>
      <p class="p">6) Destroy unwanted or expired cards. Shred or secure monthly statements and
receipts.</p>
      <p class="p">7) Electronically verify charges appearing on your monthly statement.</p>
      <p class="p">8) Unless you initiated the purchase, never give your account information
over the telephone, through the mail, or on the internet.</p>
      <p class="p">9) Consistently check your account for accuracy of personal and billing
information. Notify the bank if your personal information and/or address needs
updating.</p>
      <p class="p">10) Never let a telemarketer or salesperson pressure you into agreeing to a
deal.</p>
      <p class="p">11) Be aware of common scams and contact your A/OPC and the bank for unusual
situations.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">If Non-Cardholder Fraud Occurs</strong>. If fraud is detected on the
account, the CH must immediately report the incident to the following: BO, A/OPC
and servicing bank. The servicing bank will block and/or terminate the account.
If necessary, the bank will then issue a new card with a new account number.
Also, the bank will mail a “Statement of Fraud” letter to the cardholder, which
must be completed and returned promptly. Sometimes, unauthorized transactions
will appear on the billing statement, even though the account was reported lost
or stolen. Cardholders should report all unauthorized transactions by calling
the bank's customer service telephone number.</p>

    <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">Cardholder Fraud, Misuse and Abuse</strong>. This type of fraud
            occurs when a cardholder uses their account to transact business
            that is not sanctioned, not authorized, not in one’s official
            Government capacity, not for the purpose for which the card was
            issued, and/or not as part of official Government business.
            Intentional use of a Government account for other than official
            Government business constitutes misuse, and depending on the
            situation, may constitute fraud.</p>

        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Consequences of Cardholder Fraud</strong>. Cardholders have a
            responsibility to use the account to procure supplies and services
            at the direction of the Army under official purchase authorization.
            If a CH misuses the GPC or participates in fraud, the Army may
            cancel the purchase account and take appropriate disciplinary action
            against the CH. In the case of account misuse, the employee will be
            held personally liable to the Federal Government for the amount of
            any unauthorized transaction. Depending on the facts involved, an
            employee may be subject to fine or imprisonment for action relating
            to purchase account misuse and fraud. There are guidelines and
            procedures for disciplinary action to be taken against individuals
            for the improper, fraudulent, or abusive use of the purchase
            account. Purchase account misuse/fraud may have the following
            potential consequences:</p>
        <p class="p">1) Counseling</p>
        <p class="p">2) Cancellation of card account</p>
        <p class="p">3) Notation in employee performance evaluation</p>
        <p class="p">4) Reprimand</p>
        <p class="p">5) Suspension of employment</p>
        <p class="p">6) Termination of employment</p>
        <p class="p">7) Criminal prosecution</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">If Cardholder Fraud Occurs</strong>. If an A/OPC suspects that a BO
            or CH has committed fraud, the A/OPC can file a complaint with the
            Army Inspector General. Investigations are initiated upon receipt of
            a complaint or other information that gives a reasonable account of
            the wrongful or fraudulent act. The DoD hotline phone number is
            800-424-9098 to report fraud. A/OPCs should be as specific as
            possible when reporting fraud. The following information should be
            provided:</p>
        <p class="p">1) Employee's full name</p>
        <p class="p">2) Rank or pay grade</p>
        <p class="p">3) Duty station</p>
        <p class="p">4) Specific suspected fraudulent act or wrongdoing</p>
        <p class="p">5) Specific dates and times</p>
        <p class="p">6) Specific location of where the suspected fraudulent act
            occurred</p>
        <p class="p">7) How the individual completed the alleged fraudulent act</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Merchant Fraud</strong>. This type of fraud is committed by the
            merchant. Merchant fraud can occur either with or without the CH’s
            knowledge or consent. Rotating sources may help prevent this type of
            fraud. Billing errors, such as duplicate charges, are not considered
            merchant fraud. Examples include:</p>
        <p class="p">1) A vendor intentionally charges for items not delivered/services
            not performed.</p>
        <p class="p">2) A vendor offers bribes and gratuities to a Government employee in
            exchange for gaining purchasing activity.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">Reports for Identifying and Preventing Fraud</strong>. A/OPCs should use the
following reports to identify potential card misuse and fraud and to prevent
fraud from occurring:</p>
      <p class="p">1) <strong class="ph b">Declined Transaction Authorizations Report</strong>. This report identifies
cardholders who have attempted to use an account to buy an item for which they
are not authorized, that exceeds their single purchase limit, that exceeds their
monthly purchase limit, or from a merchant that falls under a blocked MCC.</p>
      <p class="p">2) <strong class="ph b">Transaction Detail Report</strong>. This report identifies the date,
merchant, reason code, dollar amount, and status of each dispute filed by CH.
BOs and A/OPCs should track and follow up on disputes to determine their
outcomes. Cardholders should attempt to resolve disputes directly with merchants
prior to filing a disputes report. If a merchant is consistently appearing on
the disputes report, the A/OPC should determine whether the merchant may have
billing issues, quality issues, or is attempting to commit fraud by submitting
false transactions.</p>
      <p class="p">3) <strong class="ph b">Unusual Spending Activity Report</strong>. This report identifies
transactions that may warrant further review.</p>
      <p class="p">4) <strong class="ph b">Account Status Change Report.</strong> This report lists accounts with a
change status of lost/stolen, closed, or reopened accounts. This status may
either be an indicator that the CH needs to secure the account or that the CH is
attempting to disguise misuse or fraudulent activity by denying the charges.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Reporting Fraud</strong>. All identified instances of suspected fraud or
abuse must be reported. Various channels of reporting include the Chain of
Command, the A/OPC, the command’s procurement fraud advisor (Staff/Command Judge
Advocate), the servicing Criminal Investigation Division office, internal review
organizations, and Inspector Generals at all levels. When a Defense criminal
investigative organization or Defense organizational element responsible for
investigating potential misconduct involving the GPC initiates an investigation
into allegations of charge card violations regarding a GPC, the CH’s commander
or second-line supervisor, as appropriate, and security manager must be
notified. Whenever possible, this notification should take place within 72 hours
of the initiation. See DoD Charge Card Guidebook A.1.11.</p>

            The course of action will vary depending on the intentionality and
            severity of the infraction. A/OPCs should take one or more of the
            following corrective actions:</p>
        <p class="p">1) Document the violation in the purchase file and/or CH or BO’s
            file.</p>
        <p class="p">2) Require involved parties to attend training.</p>
        <p class="p">3) Inform the involved parties’ supervisor or commander.</p>
        <p class="p">4) Suspend CH or BO account.</p>
        <p class="p">5) Terminate CH or BO appointment and account.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Continual or Severe Violations</strong>. Continual violation of GPC
            procedures by a CH or BO will result in termination of GPC
            privileges. A/OPCs will document the violation and action taken in
            their files for that particular CH/BO. A/OPCs will refer evidence of
            deliberate abuse to the CH and/or BO’s supervisor, Commander, or SCO
            for appropriate action in accordance with the Uniform Code of
            Military Justice or civilian disciplinary rules. A/OPC will refer
