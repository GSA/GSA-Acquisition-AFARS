         20 days after the Government Accountability Office (GAO) notifies the agency by telephone
         that a protest has been filed. If the GAO decides to use the express option and the

         notify the appropriate office in (<i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">i</i>)-(<i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">iii</i>) at once so that it may request an

         findings (D&amp;F) for HCA concurrence when it is necessary to request authorization to

      <p outputclass="List6" class="- topic/p ">(<i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">1</i>) Whether significant adverse consequences will necessarily
         occur if the stay is not overridden;</p>

         including the costs associated with the potential that GAO might sustain the protest,
         compare to the benefits associated with the approach being considered for addressing the
         agency’s needs; and</p>

         contracting officer must also prepare a request for approval that identifies all protest
         issues and addresses the merits and expected resolution of the protest. Include details of
         any congressional interest in the protest. After legal review, the HQAMC, Office of Command
         Counsel, will forward the request, with the D&amp;F, in accordance with agency procedures
