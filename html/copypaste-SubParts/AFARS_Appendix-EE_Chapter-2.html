   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_2-1__LboFZE">a. Nomination, selection, and appointment of CHs and BOs are in accordance with AFARS Part 5113. The nominating official must be in the supervisory chain of the individual being nominated. CHs, BOs, and Checkwriters must be issued written authority identifying their limits of authority, duties, responsibilities, credit limits, and the written authority must reference mandatory compliance with the AFARS Subpart 5113.2 and the Army Government Purchase Card Operating Procedures. The BO, or CH will acknowledge receipt (electronic signature and date permissible) of appointment letters. Warranted contracting officers do not require a separate delegation of authority to use the GPC.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_2-1__vlXJVO">b. The CH is also a Departmental Accountable Official (DAO) according to paragraph 3305 and 3306, Chapter 33, Volume 5, of the DOD FMR. CHs must successfully complete the required GPC and ethics training to be delegated micro-purchase authority prior to receiving a GPC (see paragraph 2-2). The SCO or COC may delegate in writing to the Level 3 or 4 A/OPC the authority to delegate micro-purchase authority to CHs. A sample delegation of micro-purchase authority is provided at Appendix F.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_2-1__AatiEz">c. The BO is also a Certifying Officer within the context of the GPC program. The Certifying Officer’s minimum qualifications and eligibility are further discussed in DOD FMR Volume 5, Chapter 33. BOs are responsible for the accuracy of payments, including designation of the proper appropriation(s) or other funds certified to the paying office and Disbursing Officer. BOs are financially responsible for any illegal, improper, or incorrect payment as a result of an inaccurate or misleading certification. To certify GPC invoices for payment by the DFAS, the BO must be appointed as and accept the responsibilities of a Certifying Officer using the DD Form 577 and complete ethics and fiscal law training (see paragraph 2-2). The BO completes and signs the DD577 and provides to the A/OPC in order for the A/OPC to set up the BO account. The A/OPC provides the original signed and completed DD Form 577 to the supporting DFAS, ATTN: GPC. The BO and A/OPC retain a copy.</p>

GPC A/OPCs are required to track the training (including refresher training) of all program participants (CHs, A/BOs, Certifying Officers (CO), and A/OPCs) in a system of records and ensure that the required DAU initial and refresher training (Courses CLG001 and CLG004, respectively) have been completed. Successful completion of the initial training course is required before issuing cards. Successful completion of the refresher training course must be satisfied once every two years by program officials in order to continue in their roles. A/OPCs must ensure completion of the refresher training requirement is part of their annual review of all managing accounts under their cognizance.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_2-2__tHeNVa">e. CHs and BOs who fail to complete biennial refresher training must have their GPC account suspended until training is completed. The SCO or the local GPC activity may require refresher training more frequently to satisfy their training or operational needs. The training requirement for CHs and BOs trained at a previous duty station may be abbreviated or waived, in writing, as determined by the current A/OPC.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_2-2__fHDlQk">f. All trainees must sign a statement of training certifying they have received the initial GPC program training, they understand the training provided, GPC program training materials have been provided or made available, and they understand the penalties associated with misuse of the card. Cardholders should provide their Level 4 A/OPC with a copy of the training certificate and retain the original.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_2-3__lQilwP">a. GPCs are issued only as mission requirements dictate. Only DOD civilian employees, military personnel, or members of the Armed Forces may be issued a GPC or be appointed a BO. GPCs may not be issued to contractor personnel, except as provided in Section 1-6. Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC) instructors, OCONUS local national employees of the Army, and host Government direct hires for OCONUS agencies/organizations whose salaries are reimbursed by the Army, are not considered DOD contractors, and may be designated as CHs and BOs.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_2-3__wQekiy">b. The spending limits and cycle limits can be changed as necessary to meet operational needs. The RM Office establishes the default and alternate lines of accounting for the proper designation of appropriation, and inputs the spending limits in Access Online (AXOL).</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_2-3__jxZpzd">c. Each GPC account has a single purchase transaction limit and monthly purchase limit. Generally the single purchase limit is the micro-purchase threshold. The cumulative spending total of all CHs’ monthly purchases make up the billing cycle limit for the BO. Total monthly purchases may not exceed the billing cycle limit that is established in the Servicing Bank’s transaction authorization system. The CH’s monthly spending limits are modified by the RM in AXOL when operational circumstances warrant. The Level 4 A/OPC is notified of the monthly spending limits change, approves the change, and forwards the change to the Servicing Bank.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_2-5__JHllGt">a. Use of the GPC by an authorized CH to make an unauthorized purchase is the liability of the Government. However, the installation/organization is responsible for taking appropriate action against the CH including efforts to recover the funds.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_2-5__QySiYE">b. The intentional use of the GPC for other than official Government business may be considered an attempt to commit fraud against the U.S. Government. Misuse may result in immediate cancellation of an individual's card, financial liability, and negative administrative and/or disciplinary action against the CH and, if warranted, against the BO.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_2-5__SMoGFM">c. Liability: GPC BOs are personally and pecuniarily liable for the full amount of any improper payments resulting from misuse, abuse, or unauthorized purchases of the GPC, in accordance with Title 31 U.S.C. § 3528. Strict pecuniary liability attaches automatically when there is an erroneous (illegal, improper, or incorrect) payment. GPC CHs are pecuniarily liable for erroneous payments that result from the negligent performance of duties in the amount of erroneous payment, up to one month’s pay. All accountable officials are required to comply with DOD regulations, policies, and procedures, including standard operating procedures. Failure to act in accordance with such regulations, policies, and procedures is generally considered evidence of negligence. Following orders from superiors that are contrary to regulations, policies, and procedures, is no defense to negligence or bad faith. A heavy workload or a lack of experience, supervision, or training, is not a factor in determining relief from liability.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_2-5__NFgZSJ">d. Statutory authority: Any misuse of the GPC is subject to criminal, civil, Uniform Code of Military Justice, administrative, and disciplinary actions as appropriate.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_2-5__lCqwEp">(1) CHs: DOD FMR defines a CH as a DAO, and as such, are liable for up to one month’s pay for misuse resulting from their negligent actions. DOD Directive 7000.14-R imposes financial liability for negligent performance of the CH’s duties. The FMR Vol. 5, Chapter 33, §3309 also discusses pecuniary liability. Accountable Officials shall be personally and pecuniarily liable for erroneous payments that result from the negligent performance of duties in the amount of the erroneous payment, up to one month’s pay.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_2-5__jtldxy">(2) BOs: Title 31 U.S.C. §3528 provides for personal and pecuniary liability for improper payments resulting from misuse/abuse of the purchase card for Certifying Officials. The GPC BO meets the definition for Certifying Officer in the DOD FMR. The BO is financially liable for improper payments resulting from misuse or abuse of the GPC. The act of certifying a billing statement for payment makes the BO financially responsible for illegal, improper, or incorrect payment due to an inaccurate or misleading certification. Consequently, a BO who knowingly makes a false certification may be asked to repay the Government for the items or service purchased. If a BO is unsure about certification, he/she should contact the supporting Level 4 A/OPC for guidance and/or assistance.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_2-5__EkyUGo">e. Investigation Required: When a review/audit of the GPC account indicates questionable purchases, to include unauthorized purchases, the reviewer must ask the Certifying Officer for justification. If there is no justification, the reviewer must notify the BO’s Commander or Director. The Commander or Director must conduct an investigation in accordance with AR 15-6. The investigation must provide the DOD employee or military member with an opportunity to rebut the presumed liability. Failure to follow regulation and policy constitutes negligence.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_2-6__fWYXxT">a. In accordance with DOD business practices, when any of the following conditions exist the Servicing Bank automatically suspend BO accounts when:</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_2-6__zzlrUl">(1) BO’s account goes over 60 days past due (90 days after the billing date), that BO’s account, and those of all assigned CHs within the account, is suspended until the delinquent payment is posted at the Servicing Bank.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_2-6__SIjVAj">(2) BO’s account goes over 180 days past due (210 days after the billing date) all accounts assigned under the respective Level 4 A/OPC is suspended.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_2-6__JGmYMl">(3) BO’s account has more than 20 open Card and/or checking accounts, the BO’s account is suspended unless a waiver has been approved by the Army Level 2 A/OPC.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_2-6__btVgqe">b. Only the Army Level 2 A/OPC may reopen suspended accounts before the cause of the suspension has been corrected. Before reopening a closed account due to a delinquent payment, the Level 3 A/OPC documents the payment was made to the Servicing Bank to clear the delinquency. Accounts will be closed permanently if more than two suspensions occur within a 12-month period. Only the Army Level 2 A/OPC may approve waivers to this policy.</p>

      <p class="p" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_2-7__wEwFae">c. The Servicing Bank must ensure that adequate controls are in place to ensure the security of transaction data within their electronic access system. Only the cardholder or A/BO can approve, dispute, or reallocate purchase card transactions. The Servicing Bank must ensure that adequate controls are in place within their data warehouse to preclude anyone other than the A/BO or alternate A/BO from accessing, making changes and certifying the monthly bill.</p>
