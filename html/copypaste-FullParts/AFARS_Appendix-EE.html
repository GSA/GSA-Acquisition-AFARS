Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFARS) Appendix EE provides
policy guidance and procedures for the management of the Army
Government Purchase Card (GPC) program. It implements and
supplements sections of the Department of Defense (DoD) Government
Charge Card Guidebook for Establishing and Managing Purchase,
Travel, and Fuel Card Programs (hereinafter referred to as the DoD
Charge Card Guidebook). In the event of a conflict between DoD
policy and Army policy, DoD policy takes precedence. In the event
of a conflict between Army policy and command policy, Army policy
takes precedence over any less-restrictive command policy. These
operating procedures neither supersede nor take precedence over
more-restrictive Army command procedures. This document applies to
all purchases utilizing Army-issued GPCs.</p>

Secretary of the Army (Procurement) (ODASA(P)). Submit requests for

Appendix EE is mandatory.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. The GPC program provides Army and supported
organizations a simplified, streamlined method of purchasing and
paying for supplies, services, construction projects, and contract
payments. The program complies with Federal, DoD, and Army
statutory and regulatory guidance, as well as the terms and
conditions specified in the most current General Services
Administration (GSA) SmartPay® 3 Master Contract. The primary
benefit of the GPC Program is that the card-issuing banks provide a
commercial purchase and payment service that replaces the
paper-based, time-consuming purchase order process; reduces
procurement lead time; provides transaction cost savings; reduces
procurement office workload; provides refunds; and facilitates
payment to include reductions in interest payments.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. The AFARS Appendix EE provides the procedures
to use within the Army, including Army National Guard (ARNG) and
Air National Guard (ANG), to establish and manage the Army GPC
program. Army activities may supplement (i.e., adopt more stringent
internal control requirements than the requirements cited herein),
but not change this policy. However, as these are risk-managed
programs, activities should maintain a proper balance between the
control environment and ease of use to ensure that the benefits of
the card continue to accrue. These procedures establish Army-wide
standards designed to provide all Army activities with a foundation
upon which to build specific standard operating procedures
governing their programs.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. Nonappropriated Fund (NAF) activities implement
policies and procedures governing the Army’s Morale, Welfare,
and Recreation programs and regulations for Nonappropriated Fund
Instrumentalities (NAFI). Chaplaincy activities implement policies
and procedures governing Army Chaplain Corps activities. Army
NAFIs/entities must operate within the parameters of these
procedures to include Public Health Command (PHC) NAFIs, Department
of Defense Education Activities (DoDEA) NAFIs, and Army National
Guard NAFIs. NAF activities will comply with the Department of
Defense Policies and Procedures Governing Non-Appropriated Funds
SmartPay® 3 Government-wide Commercial Purchase Card Use
– SP3 Transition Memorandum #11. Non-appropriated funds
(NAF)-funded GPCs issued under SmartPay3 must be properly
segregated for oversight. All NAF GPC Cardholder (CH) accounts must
be established under separate managing accounts (MAs). Commingling
of appropriated and non-appropriated funded cards under a single MA
is strictly prohibited.</p>

        <p class="p List1">a. GPC programs require procurement authority to
operate and cannot be established or maintained unless procurement
authority is granted in accordance with governing laws and
regulations and delegated through a contracting activity identified
in Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS)
Procedures, Guidance, and Information (PGI) 202.101 and the DoD
Charge Card Guidebook. Contracting authority flows from authorities
granted in Titles 10 and 41, United States Code (10 and 41 USC)
from DoD to the Secretary of the Army to the Heads of Contracting
Activities (HCAs). The HCA re- delegates contracting authority to
local procurement offices. The Senior Contracting Official (SCO) or
Chief of Contracting Office (CCO) may re-delegate their GPC
procurement authority listed in Table 1-3 to OA/OPCs or A/OPCs for
OA/OPCs and A/OPCs to appoint cardholders and convenience check
account holders through the Delegation of Contracting Authority

application within PIEE, is the mandatory enterprise tool for
appointing and delegating authority to GPC personnel.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. Orientation and training are prerequisites to
receiving GPC delegated authority via an appointment in JAM.
Training requirements are listed in Chapter 4.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. Generally, only a government employee can be a
cardholder or billing official. National Guard traditional members
and State employees should not be CHs or BOs. The following
exceptions apply:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Foreign nationals may be appointed as CHs only
if they are direct-hires working for the U.S. Government. However,
commanders/directors should consider the potential consequences of
appointing foreign nationals as CHs in countries where Status of
Forces Agreements (SOFAs) or local laws do not subject the foreign
national employee to the same pecuniary or general financial
liability or disciplinary actions for charge card violation as U.S.
citizens.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC)
instructors are members of the Armed Forces in accordance with

tenant organizations where the Army has contracting authority and
oversight responsibilities (such as ANG units).</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. The ODASA(P) has overall responsibility for the

utilizing Army GPCs has the responsibility for the following
actions:</p>

internal controls to ensure the appropriate management, operation,
training, and oversight is in place to operate a local GPC program
effectively and efficiently in compliance with Army policies and

the applicable convenience check MPT. DoD FMR Volume 10, Chapter 23
establishes the financial management policy for convenience check

        <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Micro-Purchase Emergency-Type
Operations (ETO) CH and/or Check Writer</strong>. This authority
allows CHs to buy commercially available, fixed-price supplies and
services to fulfill mission-essential requirements in direct
support of a declared contingency or emergency event. The ETOs
currently included in 41 USC 1903 are:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Contingency Operations as defined in FAR
2.101;</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Operations to facilitate the defense against or

        <p class="p List2">3) Operations in support of a request from the
Secretary of State or the Administrator of the United States Agency
for International Development to facilitate the provision of
international disaster assistance as addressed in FAR 18.001;
and</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Operations to support response to an emergency

implemented in

FAR 26.2). </p>
        <p class="p" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-8___2rrrqc1">The group term “ETO” also includes humanitarian or
peacekeeping operations (as defined in FAR 2.101). Currently, when
supporting humanitarian or peacekeeping operations in accordance
with FAR 2.101, the MPT does not increase, regardless of whether
the humanitarian or peacekeeping operation is taking place inside
or outside the United States; and the SAT can increase to $500,000
upon determination by the HCA that the respective supplies or
services directly support the humanitarian or peacekeeping
operation. FAR 18.2 addresses Emergency Acquisition Flexibilities
(EAFs). It is critical to verify whether increased EAFs have been
authorized for the particular ETO being supported. If so, each HCA
has the authority to authorize use of EAFs. </p>
        <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-8__Table_1-4_Emergency-Type_Operations">d. <strong class="ph b">Warranted
Overseas ETO Cardholder.</strong> This authority allows CHs to use
the GPC in conjunction with their separately issued SF 1402
Certificate of Appointment to purchase supplies and services as
prescribed in DFARS 213.301(3). Contracting officers may use this
authority to make purchases up to the applicable simplified
acquisition threshold in support of declared contingency or
emergency events.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Contract Ordering Official.</strong>
This authority allows CHs with the appropriate training to issue
fixed- price orders against existing contracts (e.g., GSA FSS,
BPAs, FedMall contracts, CHESS contracts) to fulfill
mission-essential requirements for supplies and services valued up
to the Contract Ordering Official single purchase limit and to use
the GPC to pay for these orders/purchases. When using this
authority, CHs must 1) ensure they are authorized to place orders
by the contract terms and conditions, 2) ensure the order will
comply with all the contracts terms and conditions, and 3) follow
all applicable ordering procedures. When ordering above the MPT, CH
should obtain pricing from small business when small business can
meet the requirements. The CH should obtain quotes from at least
three sources. If restricting competition to fewer than three
sources, the CH should document the circumstances in the purchase
file. CHs with this designation will be referred to as
“Ordering Officials” throughout this document. The <a class="xref" href="https://armyeitaas.sharepoint-mil.us/:b:/r/sites/ASA-ALT-PAM/Documents/Army%20Ordering%20Officer%20Guide%20v.1%20(Feb%202024).pdf" target="_blank">Army
Ordering Officer Guide</a> standardizes procedures for selecting,
appointing, and terminating ordering officers in accordance with
AFARS 5101.602-2-92 and provides guidance for appointed
individuals. This guide is to be utilized in conjunction with AFARS
Appendix EE.</p>
        <p class="p List1">f. <strong class="ph b">Overseas Simplified
Acquisition</strong>. This authority allows CHs to make authorized
GPC purchases up to a single purchase limit of $25,000 when the CH
is outside the U.S. for items/services to be used outside the U.S.,
and that comply with the requirements of DFARS 213.301(2). When
ordering above the MPT, the CH should obtain quotes from at least
three sources. If restricting consideration to fewer than three,
document the circumstances in the purchase file.</p>
        <p class="p List1">g. <strong class="ph b">Contract Payment Official.</strong>
This authority allows CHs to use the GPC to make payments against
contracts that have been signed by a Contracting Officer when the
GPC is named as the payment method. The GPC may provide a
streamlined way of paying for contracts when a contracting officer
determines the use of the GPC is in the best interest of the
Government (AFARS 5113.202-90(d)).</p>
        <p class="p List1">h. <strong class="ph b">Miscellaneous Payments Official (SF 182
Training Payments).</strong> This authority allows CHs to make
payments for commercial training requests using the SF 182, valued
at or below $25,000 in accordance with the procedures to directly
pay the provider in DoD FMR Volume 10, Chapter 12, Section 120323,
and DoDI 1400.25, Volume 410a. The SF 182 or equivalent must be
completed prior to the training. When provided by a non-Government
source, the training must consist of a regularly scheduled,
commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) course, training conference, or
instructional service that is available to the public and priced
the same for everyone in the same category, e.g., price per
student, course, program, service, or training space.</p>
        <p class="p List1">i. <strong class="ph b">Inter/Intra-Governmental Payment
Official.</strong> This authority allows CHs to make payments to
another Federal Government entity in lieu of using a MIPR or
Inter-Governmental Payment and Collection (IPAC) in accordance with
the DoD FMR. This authority includes, but is not limited to,
payments to DLA Document Services, U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA)-offered training, GSA Global Supply, Commissary, and FedMall
GPC requisitioning. (Purchases from State and Local governments are
considered traditional open-market micro-purchases and therefore
are covered by the applicable authority listed above.) Special
requirements for this authority include the following:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) The not-to-exceed value is dictated by TFM
Volume 1, Part 5, Chapter 7000, Section 7055.20.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Federal Government entities must limit their
credit card collections so that individual transactions are no more
than $10,000, which is the daily GPC credit limit for third-party
purchases. The Treasury encourages use of IPAC for payments between
Federal Agencies, debit cards, Automated Clearing House (ACH)
debits/credits, and Fedwire transactions.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Card acceptance policies can be found in TFM
Volume I, Part 5, Chapter 7000, which addresses limitations on
credit card transactions.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) IGTs exceeding $10,000 must be made with an
alternative payment method (e.g., IPAC for payments between Federal
Agencies, debit cards, ACH debits/credits, and Fedwire
transactions).</p>

      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. The ODASA(P) has overall responsibility for the
management of the Army GPC program. The ODASA(P) appoints a CPM,
also known as the Level 2 A/OPC, to manage the Army GPC program.
The SCO, or in activities that do not have a SCO, the CCO or
equivalent, designates, at a minimum, one Level 3 OA/OPC and an
alternate Level 3 OA/OPC who, once appointed in JAM, is dedicated
to the management of the GPC Program within their
agency/organization. The SCO or CCO may further delegate in writing
the authority to appoint the Level 3 and 4 A/OPCs in accordance
with Army policy. Level 3 A/OPCs with authority to delegate
procurement authority must have the corresponding appointment
letter in JAM to appoint Level 4 A/OPCs. Level 4 A/OPCs may appoint
CHs and billing officials in JAM if they are given the authority to
delegate procurement authority and have the corresponding
appointment letter in JAM. Certifying officers must be appointed by
the organization’s designated DD 577 appointing authority in
JAM.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. The Level 3 OA/OPC duties and responsibilities
at Army major command headquarters typically warrant a grade (or
equivalent thereof) of GS-14, preferably in the contracting career
field. Exceptions may apply. The Level 3 A/OPC duties and
responsibilities for non-headquarter commands typically warrant a
grade of GS-12 to GS-14, preferably in the contracting career
field, but exceptions may apply if approved by the SCO or CCO.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. The Level 4 A/OPC duties and responsibilities
typically warrant a grade (or equivalent thereof) of GS-11 to GS-12
in any career field (e.g., 1101, 1105, or 343) if they meet the
knowledge, skills, and abilities listed below. Exceptions may
apply. The grade should reflect the corresponding complexity of
their duties and responsibilities. The A/OPC will be designated by
the appropriate contracting official to be responsible for the
management, administration, and day-to-day operation of the GPC
program at the activity. Written delegations are required in JAM,
and each A/OPC will be granted the appropriate system access (e.g.,
JAM, bank EAS) associated with their role.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. Level 3 and 4 A/OPCs must complete the training
requirements detailed in Chapter 4. Only individuals who possess
the following knowledge, skills, and abilities may be appointed as
Level 3 and 4 A/OPCs for the GPC Program:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Understanding of the relevant GPC policies,
procedures, and commercial contracting practices.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Understanding of the relevant procurement laws
and regulations.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Understanding of what constitutes an authorized
purchase transaction.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Understanding of procurement methods and
standards.</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) Ability to communicate, organize, and manage
tasks effectively.</p>
        <p class="p List2">6) Basic analytical and computer skills.</p>
        <p class="p List2">7) Ability to summarize data, prepare reports and
write effectively using proper grammar, punctuation, and tone.</p>
        <p class="p List2">8) Ability to analyze, research, and provide
concise recommendations to the chain of command on required actions
to anticipate, prevent, or correct problems in business processes
that are supported by the GPC.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. The Government Charge Card Abuse and Prevention
Act of 2012 requires all Executive Branch agencies to establish and
maintain safeguards and internal controls to prevent waste, fraud,
and abuse of purchase cards. Internal controls are tools to help
program and financial managers achieve results and safeguard the
integrity of their programs. Effective internal controls provide
reasonable assurance that significant risks or weaknesses adversely
impacting the agency's ability to meet its objectives are
prevented, minimized, or are detected in a timely manner. The Level
3 and Level 4 A/OPC will notify the BO or CH of any action taken
due to a BO’s or CH’s non-compliance with Army policies
and procedures.</p>
        <p class="p List1">f. Level 3 and Level 4 A/OPCs have the authority
to apply internal controls such as suspending or cancelling BO or
CH accounts; lowering credit limits; adding or deleting Merchant
Category Codes (MCC); and initiating additional controls as
necessary to comply with GPC policies and procedures.</p>
        <p class="p List1">g. Results of legal reviews are not sufficient
justification for CHs to proceed with a particular purchase. If a
CH or BO is unsure if they can proceed with a questionable
purchase, they should contact the Level 4 A/OPC for guidance and
confirm authority prior to making the purchase.</p>
        <p class="p List1">h. Army agencies and organizations must provide
adequate resources dedicated to the GPC program within their
agency/organization to ensure successful management of the program.
Adequate GPC resources refer to an agency’s efficient and
effective deployment of assets (e.g., span of control, personnel,
training, funding, facilities, and deployment of knowledge and
skills) as needed to comply with the policies, procedures, laws,
and regulations governing the GPC Program. Adequate resources must
be deployed to reasonably ensure that programs achieve their
intended results; resources are used consistently with agency
mission; programs and resources are protected from fraud, waste,
and mismanagement; laws and regulations are followed; and reliable
and timely information is obtained, maintained, and reported for
decision-making.</p>
        <p class="p List1">i. The local contracting office must coordinate
with the local personnel office to ensure procedures are
established requiring all individuals to coordinate with the Level
4 A/OPC when they out-process from the Army command or
activity.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">2-10.</span> Separation of Duties</h3>
      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. Separation of duties is an internal control
activity intended to provide checks and balances to the GPC process
and to prevent or minimize innocent errors or intentional fraud
occurring without detection. This internal control ensures that no
single individual has control over multiple phases of a purchase
card transaction. To protect the integrity of the procurement
process, no one person is responsible for an entire purchase card
transaction. OMB standards for internal controls require that key
duties and responsibilities be divided or segregated among
individuals to ensure they do not exceed or abuse their assigned
authority. See OMB Circular A-123, Appendix B Revised, paragraph
4.3. To the greatest extent possible, GPC duties will be assigned
to different individuals within the GPC hierarchical structure. As
stated in the DoD FMR, “separation of duties precludes errors
or attempts at fraud or embezzlement from going undetected.
Internal controls generally require a four-way separation of the
contracting, receiving/[accepting], voucher certification, and
disbursing functions.”</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. Key GPC duties include making purchases and/or
payments (CHs); verifying purchases and/or payments are proper
(BOs, Certifying Officers, and FSOs); certifying invoices for
payment (BOs, Certifying Officers, and FSOs); certifying
availability of funds (Financial RMs); receiving and accepting
supplies and services, including independent receipt and acceptance
(acceptors); disbursing funds (Disbursing Office); and conducting
policy, review, and audit functions (A/OPCs and Property Book
Officers). For example:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) BOs will not be CHs under their own MAs.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) RMs will not be CHs or BOs with responsibility
for executing their own funds.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Accountable Property Officers or their
equivalents will not be CHs with authority to purchase accountable
items (this does not apply to Property Book Hand Receipt
Holders).</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Purchases of accountable (e.g., pilferable)
property, and self-generated purchases, will have acceptance
performed by someone other than the CH, BO, and Certifying
Officer.</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) CAC-enabled systems will generate a
conflict-of-interest report to depict instances where assigned
roles do not conform to DoD policy.</p>
        <p class="p List2">6) Authorization roles will be assigned to a
user’s profile, with each profile allowing only that
individual the ability to perform specific tasks in the system.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. If resource constraints prevent assignment of
the key duties to different individuals, as set forth in paragraph
a. above, the activity must request a waiver through the Level 4
A/OPC and the CCO to the Level 3 A/OPC for approval.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. Notwithstanding the above-described waiver
process, certain key duties must not be assigned to the same
individual. In no case will the same individual be both the CH and
BO for a GPC account. In no case will the Accountable Property
Officer or A/OPC (primary or alternate) also be a CH, BO or
contracting officer making contract payments with a GPC or
executing GPC purchases. A CH who is a hand receipt holder should
not purchase property for their own use. The servicing bank
provides the functionality to generate a report identifying
potential conflicts of interest in GPC program duties.</p>

      <h3 class="title topictitle3" id="ariaid-title22">
      <span class="ph autonumber">2-11.</span> Span of Control</h3>
      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. Span of control refers to the extent of
oversight and review responsibilities placed on a single A/OPC, BO,
or CH. An appropriate span of control must efficiently and
effectively allow the A/OPC, BO, or CH to provide reasonable
assurance they can effectively perform their responsibilities
regardless of the number of accounts assigned. The assigned span of
control must factor in the monitoring and oversight
responsibilities to include the use of MasterCard’s Insights
on Demand (IOD) data mining and review process. To ensure GPC
program participants have sufficient time to complete required
reviews, GPC programs will abide by established span-of-control
limits. The following span-of-control internal controls have been
established for the Army GPC Program:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) The number of CH accounts (not individual
cardholders) assigned to a primary BO will not exceed seven.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) An individual may not be assigned more than
three CH accounts.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) An A/OPC will not be responsible for more than
250 GPC accounts (card accounts and MAs combined). This ratio will
be reevaluated biennially.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Primary A/OPC vacancies must be filled in a
timely manner to prevent excessively burdening Alternate A/OPCs
over an extended time.</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) The CPM has authority to approve deviation from
the ratios in 1) through 3) above on a case-by-case basis provided
the organization establishes sufficient local oversight and
compensating controls. Deviation approval is a CPM responsibility
and cannot be delegated.</p>
        <p class="p List2">6) For the ratios in 1) through 3) above,
compensating controls include, at a minimum, briefing the HA on the
deviation(s) and any related ramifications, during all subsequent
Semi-annual Head of Activity Review (SAHAR) briefing(s) in which
the deviation(s) remain in place.</p>
        <p class="p List2">7) For the ratio in item 2) above, as the SAHAR
does not report on the number of CH accounts assigned to an
individual, other compensating controls would need to be in place
for any deviation(s) the CPM approves. Any deviations must be
reported to the HA through the SAHAR process and annotated in the
Notes section of the SAHAR report.</p>
        <p class="p List2">8) When Army policy authorizes use of the GPC for
more complex transactions (e.g., by Ordering Officials), the Army
should institute more stringent span-of-control ratios as
appropriate.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. A/OPCs should use PIEE/JAM or the card-issuing
bank’s EAS to provide appropriate management notification and
reports on various spans of control. All Common Access Card
(CAC)-enabled systems supporting or using GPC data should utilize
functions to define and manage all hierarchies assigned within the
system—not just the GPC organizational hierarchy.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. An individual may not be assigned more than one
CH account for each special designation in their appointment.
Assignment of roles includes effective from/to dates. This includes
personnel assignment to an A/OPC, BO, or CH, as well as the
relationships of the BO to the A/OPC and the CH to the BO.
Management oversight reports should be defined to report personnel,
position, and relationship assignments.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. The card-issuing bank’s EAS report on
span of control based on user ID cannot be used as an irrefutable
source to support span-of-control limits, since an individual may
have more than one bank user ID. A/OPCs must track all roles an
individual has been provisioned/assigned using their unique CAC
public-key infrastructure or other unique identifier that may be
implemented by the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and
Readiness.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. The Army standard for span of control for a
Level 4 A/OPC is 250 BO and CH accounts per Level 4 A/OPC. This
total includes both the BO and CH accounts added together. Span of
control updates are deemed necessary due to changing program
dynamics and increased oversight burdens placed on GPC oversight
personnel over time. As the micro-purchase threshold has increased
multiple times over the years, additional oversight has been
required by GPC personnel as the average dollar value and the types
and complexity of the GPC supplies and services being purchased has
increased.</p>
        <p class="p List1">f. The total number of transactions, as well as
the number of assigned card accounts, must be considered when
determining an acceptable card account to BO ratio. When the number
of accounts or workload complexity/administration assigned to a
Level 4 A/OPC exceeds the Army standard, the SCO/CCO must ensure
adequate resources are made available to allow the A/OPC to
successfully perform their duties. When the span of control exceeds
the Army standard and the CCO elects not to provide additional
resources, the CCO must submit a waiver request in writing to the
CPM for approval. The waiver request must include the rationale and
justification upon which the CCO has based the determination that
the existing span of control is adequate to ensure program
administration and that surveillance can be performed at a
satisfactory level given the existing or new compensatory controls
put in place. The Level 3 A/OPC must retain a copy of this
documentation.</p>
        <p class="p List1">g. The Level 4 A/OPC determines whether the BO to
CH ratio is acceptable upon issuance of a GPC, during the
A/OPC’s annual assessment of their GPC program, or as needed.
There must be a reasonable expectation that the BO can complete a
thorough review of all transactions and certify the invoice within
five business days of its receipt. When the ratio for CH accounts
to BO exceeds the Army standard, the BO should lower the number of
card accounts or request a waiver to policy. The Level 4 A/OPC will
document all cases where the CH to BO ratio exceeds the Army
standard. The waiver to policy request must address the unique
conditions that affect the process and show, with a high degree of
certainty, that the BO can be expected to comply with the review
and certification procedures. The request must include the number
and location of assigned CHs, the total average number of
transactions made by the CHs, the amount of time the BO can devote
to the certification process, the history of delinquencies, and
other appropriate factors. The waiver is approved at the following
levels indicated below and maintained by the approver with copies
furnished to the BO:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) 8–10 card accounts. Routed through the
Level 4 A/OPC to the CCO.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) 11–19 card accounts. Routed through the
A/OPCs (Level 4 and Level 3) to the SCO.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) 20 or more card accounts. Routed through the
A/OPCs (Level 4 and Level 3) to the Level 2.</p>

intermediary. “EDI” refers to the automated process for
receiving electronic transactions, obligations, invoice, receiving,
and other records from a card-issuing bank via GEX to the
accounting, ERP, DFAS, or other system. To ensure funding
confirmation and reconciliation information integrity, original
transactions/invoices will be maintained and cannot be altered.
Cardholders will not be able to alter their statements of account
once they approve them unless a BO returns a statement to a CH for

will ensure any corrections or additions to the original invoice
(e.g., reallocations to different funding lines) are proper and the
payment totals have not changed. Altering a voucher that is already
certified invalidates the original certification. Known or
suspected fraudulent transactions not initiated by the authorized
CH will be reported as external fraud directly to the card-issuing

includes capabilities to track and report training course
completion, issue automatic training reminders for recurring

to complete training prior to appointment issuance. To promote
compliance with training requirements, JAM system validations
prohibit appointment of individuals who, if required for their
roles, have not completed CLG 0010 and CLG 006. A system interface
has been deployed to automatically record completion of all
required and recommended DAU courses.  When tracking training
in JAM, GPC Program PIEE users are not required to manually load
electronic copies of training certificates for courses that
automatically were recorded via the DAU/PIEE system interface
(i.e., DAU is listed as the “Source”). Data is
displayed in the JAM application and available through EDA Advance
Reporting with DAU listed as “DAU,” as the source is
directly from the system of record. Because DAU is the primary
source for validating course completion, when training completion
is recorded via the DAU interface, the trainee is not required to
provide a copy (electronic or paper) to GPC program management,
thereby reducing paperwork, improving auditability, and ensuring
proper record retention. PIEE additionally includes the
capability for GPC program participants to manually record
completion of non-DAU training and provide/maintain an electronic
copy of training certificates, which are then available to program
managers and auditors as necessary. DoD GPC One-Pagers <a class="xref" href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/asda/dpc/ce/pc/docs/training/3OP010_Uploading-Training-Certificates-to-PIEE-JAM.pptx" target="_blank">3OP010

      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. Prior to assuming their duties, program
personnel will complete the GPC training appropriate to their
position. The training requirements for CHs and BOs trained at a
previous duty station may be abbreviated or waived, in writing, as
determined by the A/OPC. Proof of training must be documented and
retained by the A/OPC. The local command may require additional
mandatory training to satisfy their training or operational
needs.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. PIEE/JAM is the mandatory electronic system for
documenting and retaining training records. PIEE includes
capabilities to track and report training course completion, issue
automatic training reminders for recurring requirements, and
systemically promote compliance with requirements to complete
training prior to appointment issuance. JAM system validations
prohibit appointment of individuals who, if required for their
roles, have not completed CLG 0010 and CLG 006. PIEE/JAM
automatically records completion of all required and recommended
DAU courses. When tracking training in JAM, users are not required
to manually load electronic copies (e.g., PDFs) of training
certificates for courses that automatically were recorded via the
DAU/PIEE system interface (i.e., DAU is listed as the
“Source”).</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. PIEE includes the capability for GPC program
participants to manually record completion of non-DAU training and
provide/maintain an electronic copy of training certificates. DoD
GPC One-Pagers 3OP010, Uploading Training Certificates to PIEE/JAM,
and 3OP038, Tracking Training in PIEE, provide details on these
training capabilities.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. Level 4 A/OPCs, in coordination with the
appropriate subject matter experts, will provide in-person initial
GPC training for all new BOs and CHs prior to using the GPC. Each
Level 4 A/OPC is responsible for providing training to CHs and BOs
utilizing the Army Master Training slides and GPC program
location-specific slides. Training methods can be classroom,
virtual or electronic.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. Resource Managers should assist the A/OPC in
developing or providing training on funding document maintenance,
Anti-Deficiency Act, and the certification and payment process.</p>
        <p class="p List1">f. Small Business Specialists should assist the
A/OPC in developing or providing training on FAR 19, Small Business
procedures and achieving small business goals.</p>
        <p class="p List1">g. Hazardous Materials Management Process Team
should assist the A/OPC in developing or providing training on the
procurement, maintenance, and disposal of hazardous materials.</p>
        <p class="p List1">h. GPC training requirements are listed in Tables
4-1 and 4-2. Table 4-1 lists all mandatory training which must be
completed prior to issuance of an appointment letter and/or
establishment of a GPC account. Table 4-2 lists all recommended
training as necessary to carry out GPC duties. Proof of training
must be documented and retained by the A/OPC. CHs, BOs, and A/OPCs
are required to complete mandated initial and refresher training.
U.S. Bank’s Access Online web-based training is optional. The
initial in-person GPC training provided by the Level 4 A/OPC will
cover training on the use of U.S. Bank’s Access Online system
(e.g., initiating and resolving disputes, reconciling and approving
statements, certifying invoices, and uploading supporting
documentation).</p>
        <p class="p List1">i. <strong class="ph b">Refresher Training</strong>. As
required in DoD FMR Volume 5, Chapter 5, Paragraph 050304,
appointed Certifying Officers must complete an approved Certifying
Officer Legislation training course before their appointment and as
refresher training annually. All A/OPCs, BOs, and CHs must complete
refresher training every two years. The local command may require
refresher training more frequently to satisfy their training or
operational needs. See <a class="xref" href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/asda/dpc/ce/pc/training.html" target="_blank">

        <p class="p List1">j. By signing the appointment letter in JAM, CHs
and BOs confirm that they have received the initial GPC program
training and understand their roles and responsibilities and the
penalties associated with misuse of the card.</p>
        <p class="p List1">k. Attendance at the annual GSA SmartPay
Conference is mandatory for all Level 3 and 4 A/OPCs, as funding
permits. Attendance is mandatory for all Level 3 and 4 A/OPCs if

        <p class="p List1">a. Nomination, selection, and appointment of BOs
and CHs are in accordance with DoD Charge Card Guidebook Chapters
A.1.1 and A.3. A/OPCs must receive written and signed approval from
the BO/CH’s supervisory chain of command before initiating
their appointment process. BOs should be in the supervisory chain
of command of the CH.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. Army BOs will receive both Approving/Billing
Official and Certifying Officer appointments. Army BOs both approve
and certify statements during the certification process. Approving
Officials (AOs) follow pay and confirm procedures and are not
appointed as Certifying Officers, e.g., Air Force AOs under the
Army program.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. GPC Delegation of Authority and appointment
letters will clearly state the duties of the program participant,
any dollar limit of the procurement authority (when applicable),
and any limitations on the scope of authority to be exercised other
than those contained in applicable law or regulation. All
delegates/appointees must countersign their letters electronically
in JAM to acknowledge they understand and concur with their GPC
program responsibilities prior to establishing any accounts in the
bank’s EAS.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. A/OPCs will maintain and monitor all
delegations, appointments letters, and training certificates
electronically in JAM in accordance with section 6-13. If
electronic versions are available, the Level 4 A/OPC is not
required to maintain a hard copy. Audit agencies can request access
to PIEE modules when required. Ensure military and civilian
out-processing checklists include a mandatory A/OPC sign-off for
BOs and CHs.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Receiving a GPC</strong>. Standard
practice is to have the card mailed to the CH’s work address
in accordance with the GSA SmartPay®3 contract. Using a
CH’s home address may be a fraud indicator and should not be
a normal practice. Whether the card is mailed to the CH’s
primary work address or an alternate address, the CH must maintain
the physical security of the card. Examples of alternate address
uses include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) When an A/OPC wants all cards mailed to the
A/OPC’s work address, and then the A/OPC provides each card
to the new CH’s work location.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) When the A/OPC feels it is more reliable to
have the card mailed to the A/OPC’s work address and then
sent by express mail to a CH’s work address overseas.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) When the organization has a policy that all
cards will be sent to the work address of the responsible BO, who
will then deliver each card to the CH in person or to the
CH’s work address.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) When the CH will not be at the work location
(duty station) for an extended period (COVID-19 stay-at-home orders
would be one such example), the CH’s home address could be
used. If</p>
        <p class="p">the CH’s home address is used for card delivery, a note or
memorandum for record must be added to the account notes stating
why the home address was used.</p>

        <p class="p List1">a. GPCs are issued only as mission requirements
dictate. Only DoD civilian employees or members of the Armed Forces
may be issued a GPC or be appointed a BO. GPCs may not be issued to
contractor personnel, except as provided in paragraph 1-5d. Junior
Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC) instructors, Outside
Continental United States (OCONUS) local national employees of the
Army, and host Government direct-hires for OCONUS
agencies/organizations whose salaries are reimbursed by the Army or
DoD tenant organizations, are not considered DoD contractors, and
may be designated as CHs and BOs. Traditional National Guard
members and State employees are prohibited from being appointed as
a CH, BO or A/OPC. The following types of purchases require a
separate card account dedicated solely for that purpose:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Contract Payments</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Official Representation Funds (ORF)</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Ammunition</p>

(SIK)</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Card Account Limits</strong>. Each card
account has a single purchase limit and a cycle or monthly limit.
In most cases, the single purchase limit is the micro-purchase
threshold. The cycle limit is determined by the anticipated
spending needs of the cardholder.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Managing Account Limits</strong>. Each
managing account has a cycle limit and a credit limit. The cycle
limit is the sum of the monthly limits of all cardholders under the
managing account. The credit limit is three times the managing
account’s cycle limit.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Establishing Credit Limits</strong>.
A/OPCs and RMs must jointly establish appropriate spending limits,
and MCC access tailored to each CH account and MA based on
historical buying patterns/trends, with consideration given to
future mission needs. Budgetary limits may equal but not exceed the
limits established in the CH appointment letter issued in JAM. The
bank’s EAS will maintain single purchase and monthly spending
limits and can restrict purchases to particular MCCs. These limits
may be initially established based on the CH’s delegation
authority and adjusted to meet budgetary constraints. The
procurement authority in the letter of delegation may never exceed
what is authorized by the FAR/DFARS (e.g., a CH with delegated
authority of $10,000 is still limited to $2,500 when purchasing
services subject to Service Contract Labor Standards (41 USC
Chapter 67)). The A/OPC will review individual CH spending limits
each year and coordinate with the BO and RM in the event adjustment
of spending limits as projected for the upcoming year is required.
A/OPCs must update the appointment in JAM before increasing credit
limits in the EAS. The A/OPC and the RM may make changes to the
purchase limits to meet mission requirements within the CH’s
authority.</p>

violations (e.g., abuse, delinquency, internal fraud, or misuse)
are subject to administrative and disciplinary action. Pecuniary
liability may apply when there is an erroneous (illegal, improper,
or incorrect) payment. Commanders may take corrective action,
impose disciplinary action (including removal for serious or
repeated infractions), and take other administrative actions for
GPC infractions. If a potential GPC violation is discovered, GPC
personnel will ensure the violation is appropriately
investigated.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. Cardholders and billing officials are
designated as accountable officials per DoD FMR Volume 5, Chapter
5, paragraph 1.1.2. Certifying Officers (i.e., billing officials)
may be held pecuniary liable under USC Title 10, Subtitle A, Part
IV, Chap 165, Sec 2773a for an illegal, improper, or incorrect
payment.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. Cardholders who make unauthorized purchases or

for any payment certified based on false or negligent information
they provided to the Certifying Officer.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Command/SCO Oversight</strong>. The
Command/SCO must establish and maintain a command climate to
prevent undue influence over the actions of a cardholder. The
Command/SCO will establish local policies and procedures
identifying informal and formal disciplinary actions to be taken in
the event of noncompliance, fraud, misuse, and abuse. Disciplinary
actions should be based on the severity and frequency of the
infraction and can range from informal actions (such as written or
verbal counseling) to demotion, removal, or potential criminal
prosecution.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Investigation Required</strong>.
Commands must be notified when evidence of fraud or other criminal

referred to the CH’s and/or BO’s command for
appropriate action. The investigation must provide the Army
employee or military member with an opportunity to rebut the
presumed liability.</p>

suspend BO and CH accounts due to non-compliance with GPC policies
and procedures.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Automatic Suspensions</strong>.
Requests for suspension exemptions for BO accounts with operational
emergencies may be granted on a case-by-case basis. Exemption
requests must be submitted in writing from the Level 4 A/OPC to the
Level 3. In accordance with DoD business practices, U.S. Bank will
automatically suspend BO accounts under the following
conditions:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) BO’s account goes over 60 days past due
(90 days after the billing date). The managing account and all card
accounts under it are suspended until the delinquent payment has
posted.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) BO’s account goes over 180 days past due
(210 days after the billing date). All managing accounts assigned
under the Level 4 agent are suspended until delinquent payment has
posted. The delinquent managing account is permanently closed
(T9).</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) BO’s account has more than 20 open card
and/or checking accounts. The managing account is suspended unless
a waiver has been approved by the Army Level 2 A/OPC.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Before reopening a closed account due to a
delinquent payment, the Level 3 and/or 4 A/OPC will document that
U.S. Bank received full payment. Only the Army Level 2 may reopen
suspended accounts prior to payment being received by U.S. Bank.
Accounts will be closed permanently if more than two suspensions
occur within a 12-month period. Only the Army Level 2 A/OPC may
approve waivers to this policy.</p>

Card Security</h3>
      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. CHs are responsible for properly using and
safeguarding their GPC. CHs must take appropriate precautions
comparable to those taken to secure personal checks, credit cards,

prevent compromise. The card should never be surrendered, except
when the account is going to be cancelled. Additionally, the

      <span class="ph autonumber">6-1.</span> Procurement Transactions</h3>
      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. Purchases below the MPT are exempt from the
Competition in Contracting Act, Buy American Act, Economy Act,
Service Contract Labor Standards Act, Wage Rates Requirements Act,
and the Small Business Set-Aside Program. Nothing in this chapter
exempts a cardholder from using the proper contracting channels
when making purchases exceeding the MPT.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. Requiring activities must perform acquisition
planning to identify procurement needs; consider strategic sourcing
vehicles (e.g., BPAs, CHESS, GSA); and initiate procurement actions
with sufficient lead time to buy appropriate products at the right
price from the right suppliers in a timely manner. Requirements and
logistics personnel should avoid issuing requirements on an urgent
basis or with unrealistic delivery or performance schedules, since
it generally restricts competition and increases prices. Ordering
from existing contracts (e.g., BPAs, CHESS, or GSA FSS) can only be
done by an appointed ordering official, including purchases below
the MPT.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. Purchase requirements exceeding the MPTs, or
delegations of authority established in Tables 1-2 and 1-3 must be
referred to a contracting office. Splitting requirements into
smaller parts to avoid formal contracting procedures, competition
requirements, or to keep spending limitations under the MPT is
prohibited. The GPC may be used for non-personal recurring services
performed at regular intervals up the MPT. Recurring service
requirements estimated to exceed the MPT per FY must be directed to
the contracting office. There is no single source that states
contracts must be put in place for a recurring supply requirement
costing $10k or less per 12-month period. The contracting office
will determine if recurring supplies should be placed on a contract
or BPA.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. Cardholders must use the mandatory sources
identified in Chapter 9 before deciding to use commercial sources.
GPC micro-purchases should be distributed equitably among qualified
suppliers, with special consideration paid to supporting the
installation AbilityOne Base Supply Center, and local, small, and
small disadvantaged businesses.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. Cardholders are responsible for procuring green
products and services under the Green Procurement Program as
prescribed by Executive Order 13834 and by DoD and Army policies.
Green procurement applies to the purchase of recovered materials,
energy and water efficient products, alternative fuels and fuel
efficiency, bio-based products, non-ozone depleting substances,
environmentally preferable products and services, and toxic and
hazardous chemicals. The following are mandatory Green Procurement
purchases: paper, toner, office products, office recycle
containers, and office trash cans. The following are the only
exceptions to purchasing green products and services: the pricing
is considered unreasonable; item/service does not meet reasonable
standards; or item/service will not meet the time frame needed.
Exceptions must be documented. Recommended sources for green
products are AbilityOne, FedMall, and GSA Advantage.</p>
        <p class="p List1">f. <strong class="ph b">OCONUS Units</strong>. For the use of
the GPC outside the U.S., CHs must follow policy in accordance with
DFARS 213.301(2). To ensure the CH does not exceed $25,000 for
OCONUS purchases, the total purchase price must include the
currency conversion rate prior to making the purchase. If a CH
makes a purchase from an OCONUS location for use OCONUS and the
vendor location is CONUS, this would be considered a reach-back
purchase and the MPT for a reach-back purchase is $10,000. Any
reach- back purchase over $10,000 is subject to simplified
acquisition procedures and should be sent to the contracting office
for action.</p>
        <p class="p List1">g. For purchases made in the Contiguous United
States (CONUS) for use overseas, the CH must contact their local
Director of Logistics Traffic Management Office for assistance
regarding transportation and packaging requirements and/or
instructions prior to contacting the vendor. CHs must ensure the
final price includes all costs associated with the mode of
transportation and packaging selected to the destination country,
customs import duties, and any other charges that may accrue. See
DoD Directive 4500.54-E, DoD Foreign Clearance Program for
compliance with host nation customs requirements.</p>
        <p class="p List1">h. <strong class="ph b">OCONUS Value-Added Tax (VAT)
Forms</strong>. The cost of the VAT can be charged on the GPC.
Cardholders must contact their A/OPC for local guidance and
procedures involving the use of the VAT form. To obtain a copy of
the form, CHs may contact the local Morale, Welfare and Recreation
(MWR) office.</p>
        <p class="p List1">i. <strong class="ph b">Terms and Conditions</strong>. Neither
cardholders nor billing officials have the authority to approve or
sign written vendor terms and conditions. Cardholders will consult
their A/OPC, contracting office, and/or local legal office for
additional guidance.</p>
        <p class="p List1">j. <strong class="ph b">Convenience Check Accounts</strong>.
The management controls, procedures, and restrictions included in
this regulation also apply to the use of convenience checking
accounts. Convenience checks are an alternative only when the GPC
is not feasible and the activity has evaluated all alternatives and
determined the checks as the most advantageous. Before a check is
issued, the requiring organization must document their effort to
find a merchant that accepts the GPC. Convenience checks must not
be used for more than one half of the MPT per Public Law 115-91.
Checkwriters who write checks over the convenience check MPT (see
Table 1-2) will have their convenience check account terminated.
See Chapter 10.</p>

to ship to personal residences or other commercial addresses
without approval from Level 3 A/OPC. For OCONUS purchases, CHs
should coordinate with their local logistics office to determine
whether commercial shipment is available for purchases outside the
U.S. If it is not, ensure the vendor is provided with the necessary
information to allow the purchase to enter the Defense
Transportation System (DTS), which requires that the shipment has a
Military Shipping Label (MSL) that includes a Transportation
Control Number, Final Destination (in country) address and DoD

      <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Precautions to Avoid Frustrated
Freight</strong>. A supplier shipment that becomes
“frustrated” is, at a minimum, delayed along the
transportation chain and will not move until all problems are
resolved. Many times, the shipment never reaches the intended
recipient. When using a GPC to purchase items with delivery to a
destination outside the United States, two methods of
transportation generally are available: commercial door-to-door and
the DTS. If commercial shipping is not used, a purchaser must
coordinate with his/her transportation service support office
(e.g., Installation Transportation Office, Transportation
Management Office, or Supply Support Activity) before ordering the
item. The Component ordering the item with a GPC is responsible for
ensuring the shipper (i.e., vendor) is provided the completed MSL
to place on the cargo before it arrives at a DoD facility for
movement in DTS. Shipments entering the DTS require additional
funding and shipping, marking, and packaging instructions. Prior to
shipment of hazardous material, the shipper is required to certify
shipment to the final destination by attaching a certification
certificate/document on the package in accordance with
International Air Transport Association or International Maritime
Dangerous Goods code, etc. Using only the stateside DTS military
transit port or intermediate point without including the final
destination DoDAAC in-country will cause a shipment to become

Required file documentation includes but is not limited to the following:</p>
      <p class="p List2">1) Army Purchase Request &amp; Approval (PR&amp;A)
or equivalent​*</p>
      <p class="p List2">2) 889 Representation​*</p>
      <p class="p List2">3) Invoice and/or itemized receipt​</p>
      <p class="p List2">4) Proof of independent receipt and
acceptance​</p>
      <p class="p List2">5) Other approvals, when applicable (e.g., legal,
ITAS, Statement of Non-Availability (SONA))</p>
      <p class="p List2">6) Local agency requirements</p>
      <p class="p">* For individual slot training payments, CHs must upload the SF
182 or equivalent in lieu of items 1) and 2) above. CHs must redact
any personally identifiable information (PII) before uploading.</p>
      <p class="p List1">h. The Accountable Property Officer (APO)
determines if the goods purchased will be placed on APO records in
accordance with AR 710-4. Cardholders are required to provide
receipts of accountable goods to the APO within 5 business days of
obtaining the receipt.</p>
      <p class="p List1">i. <strong class="ph b">Independent Receipt and
Acceptance</strong>. CHs must obtain proof of independent receipt
and acceptance for all purchases. The CH will ensure receipt and
acceptance is properly performed and confirmed through
documentation by a government employee other than the purchasing
CH. The individual verifying receipt may be the CH’s
supervisor or other designated individual, as appropriate. CHs must
upload the documentation in the servicing bank’s EAS.
Shipping items to a home or alternative work address requires
approval documentation from the Level 3 A/OPC in the purchase file.
The BO verifies the existence of receipt and acceptance
documentation during reconciliation of the billing statement.
Acceptable documentation includes (but is not limited to) the
following:​</p>
      <p class="p List2">1) Signed invoice, packing slip or equivalent.
​In addition to the signature, the receiver should include
the date of receipt, printed name, telephone number, and office
symbol or address.</p>
      <p class="p List2">2) PR&amp;A signed by the receiver.​</p>
      <p class="p List2">3) Email confirmation from the
receiver.​</p>
      <p class="p List2">4) WAWF Purchase Card Receiving Report.</p>
      <p class="p List1">j. <strong class="ph b">File Retention</strong>. If the
complete file documentation is uploaded in the bank’s EAS,
CHs are not required to maintain a duplicate hardcopy or electronic
file. The servicing bank will retain all uploaded files for the
required timeframe. BOs are responsible for ensuring that CHs
upload documentation. BOs must retain existing hardcopy files for
six years in accordance with FAR Part 4 that are not uploaded into
the bank’s EAS.</p>
      <p class="p List1">k. <strong class="ph b">Cybersecurity</strong>. The Army GPC
community must be aware of cybersecurity risks when making
purchases using the GPC. Some of the key cyber supply-chain risks
include:</p>
      <p class="p List2">1) Services provided by vendors and other third
parties (e.g., heating, ventilation, and air conditioning services,
IT software engineering services, or anyone with access to the
physical or virtual network).</p>
      <p class="p List2">2) Poor information security practices and/or
compromised software or hardware procured from suppliers.</p>
      <p class="p">Purchases of hardware, software, telecommunications equipment,
video surveillance equipment, and related services from certain
vendors are prohibited. The <a class="xref" href="https://2017-2021.state.gov/fiscal-year-2018-national-defense-authorization-act-ndaa/index.html" target="_blank">FY

            <u class="ph u">GPC
Memorandum dated June 29, 2022</u>
          </a> provides further guidance on
completing the required fields. CHs must record 889 Designation
information in the bank’s EAS.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">889 Representation</strong>. Federal
law requires CHs to obtain a current 889 representation for each
transaction and to include the representation with their
transaction documentation. The representation contains the language
from FAR 52.204-26, Covered Telecommunications Equipment or
Services- Representation. CHs may obtain the vendor’s 889
representation by using one of the following methods:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Search for vendor on the 889 GSA Easy Search
Tool: <a class="xref" href="https://889.smartpay.gsa.gov/" target="_blank">https://889.smartpay.gsa.gov/</a>.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Use the robotic process automation (RPA) tool
to search SAM.gov. Send an email to <a class="xref" href="mailto:info@section889request.com" target="_blank">
            <u class="ph u">info@section889request.com</u>
          </a>
with the vendor’s Unique Entity ID (UEI) or Cage code in the
subject line. Do not include any text in the body of the email. The
RPA will return an email with the vendor’s FAR 52.204-26
language, if applicable.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Log into the <a class="xref" href="https://www.sam.gov/" target="_blank">
            <u class="ph u">System for Award Management
(SAM.gov) website</u>.</a> Locate the vendor’s entity
registration and review FAR 52.204-26, under Reps and Certs.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Use the vendor’s completed 889
representation form. The form must be dated and signed. Completed
forms are valid for 1 year after date of signature unless the
vendor updates their systems at which time the vendor will need to
fill out a new 889 form.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. The requirement to obtain an 889 representation
does not apply under the following conditions:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Contract payments. When the GPC is used as a
method of payment against a contract, the Contracting Officer is
responsible for ensuring compliance prior to award.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Inter/intra-governmental payments.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) SF 182 individual training payments.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Fraudulent (external) transactions.</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) Fees (e.g., convenience check fees).</p>
        <p class="p List2">6) Refunds and transaction credits/discounts.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. Pursuant to DoD policy, bank EAS entries must
indicate how the vendor’s 889 representation was obtained.
For 100% of transactions, CH must enter appropriate 889 designation
in the bank’s EAS. CHs must enter one of the allowable codes
in Table 6-2 in the following locations in the bank’s EAS, as
applicable:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) CHs creating manual orders will use the
“889 Designation” field in Order Management.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) CHs receiving editable eOrders will use the
“889 Designation” field in Order Management.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) CHs receiving non-editable eOrders will use the
“889 Designation” field in the Custom Fields tab in
Transaction Management.</p>
        <p class="p">BOs must check for bank EAS entries when reconciling. BOs and
A/OPCs must monitor 889 compliance during DM case dispositions and
should use the “Cyber Security Non-Compliance” finding
for cases without an 889 bank EAS entry once CI 193 is
implemented.</p>

      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">Use of Third-Party Payment
Processors</strong>. In no instance are CHs authorized to establish
an account when using a third-party payment processor, as doing so
could require acceptance of or agreement to terms and conditions or
result in commitment of funds that have not been legally allocated
for purchases. Transactions using third-party payment processors
are considered high risk, as all available transaction data may not
be completely passed to the issuing bank (which can adversely
affect reporting, reconciliation, and oversight, including data
mining (detection of improper card use)), and may adversely affect
transaction dispute terms and processes, among other
considerations. When selecting merchants to fulfill requirements,
CHs will use the following procedures:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Minimize use of third-party payment processors
to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Ask if the merchant would require use of a
third-party payment processor, if there is any doubt regarding
merchant use of one.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) If it is still found necessary to purchase from
a merchant requiring a third-party payment processor, CHs and BOs
must ensure adequate supporting documentation clearly showing there
was a detailed review of the purchase, and that purchase from a
merchant requiring use of a third-party payment processor was
unavoidable.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. GPC oversight personnel and CHs should be aware

        <p class="p List1">c. For purchases within the U.S., CHs are
responsible for notifying vendors of the tax exemption and ensuring
no sales tax is included in their purchase, except where
applicable. Cardholders must inform the merchant that the purchase
is for official U.S. Government purposes and, therefore, is not
subject to state or local sales tax. A/OPCs may request embossing
of the statement “U.S. GOVT TAX EXEMPT” when ordering a
GPC.</p>

Surcharges</h3>
      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. Surcharges are fees that a retailer adds to the
cost of a purchase when a customer uses a credit card. As a result
of the settlement between a class of retailers and the brands on
January 27, 2013, merchants in the U.S. and U.S. Territories are
permitted to impose a surcharge on cardholders when a credit card
is used. Not all merchants impose a surcharge, and some states
(e.g., Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, New
York, Oklahoma, Texas, and Utah) prohibit merchant surcharges.
Cardholders who receive a surcharge in any of the above-mentioned
states should report the merchant to the proper State
authority.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. Cardholders are required to be notified in

Government property are responsible for its proper custody,
safekeeping, and accountability in accordance with AR 710-4 (e.g.,
computer equipment, software, televisions, and large purchases).
ANG will follow property accountability procedures outlined in
Department of the Air Force Instruction (DAFI) 64-117. Accountable
property includes (1) Government property purchased or otherwise
obtained, having a unit acquisition cost of $5,000 or more; (2)
property of any value that is controlled or managed at the item
level; (3) leased items of any value; (4) assets that are sensitive
or classified; and (5) other items as specified by Army property

        <p class="p List2">2) CH will provide purchase receipt to APO within
5 days of obtaining the receipt.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) When performing monitoring and oversight

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">Payment Delinquency
Monitoring</strong>. A/OPCs must track managing account
certification after the end of the billing cycle and confirm
whether the payments processed. A/OPCs can use the Managing Account
Approval Status and Certification and Payment Report reports to
identify accounts that have not been certified. The servicing bank
may send reports of delinquencies and potential past due accounts.
A/OPCs can also use the Past Due report in the bank’s EAS to
identify delinquent accounts. Past due notices (delinquencies over
30 days) must be handled immediately. GPC stakeholders must work
together to research and correct any delinquency immediately.
Delinquencies that are 60 days past due should be suspended. The
Army goal is to pay all accounts on time. The Army maintains a zero
tolerance for any percentage of receivables over 180 days past
due.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. The A/OPC will monitor account certifications
and may suspend any account that is not certified within 5 business
days. If the A/OPC suspends an account, once the account is
certified, the A/OPC may reinstate the account. If the bank
suspends an account, once the account is certified and paid, the
account is automatically reinstated. The request to reinstate a
suspended account due to non- certification, must include an
explanation of the delay in certification and a plan to avoid
future delays. If the account has been suspended for late
certification more than once, any request to reinstate the account
must come from the activity responsible for the account.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. The Certifying Officer’s minimum
qualifications and eligibility are discussed in DoD FMR Volume 5,
Chapter 33. Certifying Officers are responsible for the accuracy of
payments, including designation of the proper appropriation(s) or
other funds certified to the paying office and disbursing officer.
To certify GPC invoices for payment by DFAS, the BO must be
appointed as and accept the responsibilities of a Certifying
Officer using the DD Form 577 generated in JAM. The BO certifies
the statement as the Certifying Officer, and the RM certifies the
funding in GFEBS/other.</p>
      <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Cardholder Statement Reconciliation and
Certification</strong>. The Army certifies invoices for payment
after all purchased items have been confirmed. This procedure is
called “Confirm and Pay.” Any transactions that cannot
be reconciled and approved for payment, will not be approved in the
bank’s EAS by the BO. ANG and certain other Army accounts
supporting the Air Force certify invoices for payment following the
“Pay and Confirm” model. Cardholders must match and
approve transactions throughout the month to ensure accuracy and
identify and resolve any funding errors. If a charged amount is
incorrect, the CH must contact the vendor to resolve the
discrepancy and may dispute the transaction, if necessary.
Cardholders must also upload transaction documentation throughout
the month to ensure BO visibility of purchase information. If the
statement is correct at the end of the billing cycle, the CH must
approve the statement within three business days of the billing
cycle end date. For Army agencies that do not utilize the bank's
EAS for monthly certification, per the DoD FMR, Vol 10 Chapter 23,
Figure 23-2, the CH must complete a monthly certification statement
as part of their reconciliation process.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. Cardholders are responsible for reconciling the
charges appearing on each statement for their GPC with receipts,
purchase log, and other supporting documentation. Reconciling a
card account involves the following key actions:</p>
      <p class="p List2">1) Review the transactions on the statement from
the card-issuing bank and match them to the purchase log. Note:
Transaction review and invoice obligation will be completed in only
one system (i.e., either the bank EAS or another waiver-approved
automated system, but never both). Component policy and procedures
will designate the automated system in which CHs will perform
review and obligation.</p>
      <p class="p List2">2) Reconcile/reallocate/dispute transactions, as
appropriate. For each transaction posted to the statement,
reallocate, if appropriate, from the default to an alternate LOA
and approve or dispute each charge as appropriate.</p>
      <p class="p List2">3) Approve the statement.</p>
      <p class="p List2">4) Upload supporting documentation in the
bank’s EAS.</p>
      <p class="p List2">5) If the CH does not reconcile and approve the
statement within 15 days after the close of the billing cycle, the
CH is locked out of the file and the BO is required to perform the
CH reconciliation/approval role. After a BO certifies a statement
on the bank’s EAS, the transaction file is locked and no
further changes to the invoice are permitted.</p>
      <p class="p List1">f. <strong class="ph b">Billing Official
Certification</strong>. Reconciling and certifying a managing
account involves the following key actions:</p>
      <p class="p List2">1) Review transactions to ensure they are legal,
proper, correct, and mission essential.</p>
      <p class="p List2">2) Ensure all supporting documentation is obtained
and correct. Billing officials should review the uploaded
transaction documentation in AXOL to confirm all transactions are
reconciled and approved for payment, receipt is verified, and all
supporting documentation is loaded in the bank’s EAS prior to
certification.</p>
      <p class="p List2">3) Ensure CH reviews have been completed
properly.</p>
      <p class="p List2">4) Ensure receipt of all accountable property has
been properly documented.</p>
      <p class="p List2">5) Final-approve their CHs’ transactions and
certify the billing statement within five business days of the
billing cycle end date.</p>
      <p class="p List2">6) For improper purchases (including unauthorized
charges made by a properly appointed CH or GPC transactions
0intended for Government use but not permitted by law, regulation,
or Component policy, such as splitting purchases), the Government
is liable to pay; however, action may be taken against the CH.</p>
      <p class="p List2">7) If BOs find a questionable or fraudulent
transaction, they should contact their A/OPC and follow the
guidance in section 6-10.</p>
      <p class="p List1">g. <strong class="ph b">Processing Credits</strong>. The <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#AFARS_Appendix-EE_6-9">6-9. Payments of Monthly Invoices</a> is the authoritative source of guidance related to application of credits. As stated in the FMR, transaction credits are funds sent back to DoD from the contracted bank resulting from returned items, billing errors, overpayments, duplicate payments, or erroneous payments. The <a class="xref" href="https://smartpay.gsa.gov/about/master-contract/#gsa-smartpay-3-master-contract" target="_blank">GSA SP3 Master Contract</a> defines “credit” as “any transaction that reduces the amount due to the agency/organization or account holder.” Transaction credits must be credited to the original appropriation from which they were disbursed. Transaction credits will be posted as credits against CH statements, using the default LOA at the CH statement level, and should be reallocated as appropriate if the default LOA did not incur the original expenditure. In the case where a closed account carries a credit balance, the amount will be sent via check or using ACH to an installation account predetermined by the A/OPC. Checks will be addressed to “U.S. Treasury.” The A/OPC will work with his/her RM in identifying an account and determining how the credit will be distributed across LOAs as warranted. The BO will send the check and LOA(s) to the supporting accounting office with a request to deposit.</p>

Fraudulent Transactions</h3>
      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">Disputes</strong>. Cardholders must
protect the Army’s interest by initiating disputes when
applicable. Failure to do so may result in administrative or
disciplinary action. Transaction errors, such as duplicate billing,
non-receipt or cancellation of supplies or services, returned
supplies, invoice amount discrepancies, transaction paid by other
means (e.g., split payments w/another organization), must be
handled initially between the CH and the merchant. If the merchant
is unwilling to accommodate a resolution, the CH will file a
dispute in the bank’s EAS. If a dispute is resolved in favor
of the CH, a credit will be placed on the CH’s statement. If
the dispute is resolved in favor of the merchant, a letter will be
sent to the CH explaining the decision and, since the charge was
already paid, no further action will be taken. The steps below
outline the process for disputing a charge:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Attempt to resolve any issue directly with the
merchant prior to initiating a dispute.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Document all available information and attempts
to correct the dispute. This information will become part of the
supporting documentation.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Initiate the dispute in the bank’s EAS
(only after failing to resolve the issue with the merchant) as
early as possible, but within 45 days from the posted date of the
transaction.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Respond to any bank requests for additional
information.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Defective Items</strong>. If items or
services purchased are faulty or defective, the CH will obtain a
replacement or repair of the item or re-performance of the service
as soon as possible. If the merchant refuses to credit, replace,
repair the faulty item, or re-perform the service to satisfaction,
the CH will dispute the transaction.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Fraud</strong>. If the CH discovers
fraudulent transactions (e.g., use of a lost or stolen card) on the
statement, the CH will immediately contact the bank’s
Customer Service Department. The CH should also notify his A/OPC
and BO of any fraudulent activity. If fraudulent activity is
confirmed (which means a third party has gained access to the
account), the bank will terminate the account and replace it with a
new account number. All account information will transfer to the
new account and the CH will continue to work with the servicing
bank to resolve the fraudulent transactions.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. Only the CH or BO can approve, dispute, or
reallocate purchase card transactions. The servicing bank is
responsible to ensure adequate controls are in place within their
EAS to preclude anyone other than the BO from accessing, making
changes, and certifying the monthly billing statement.</p>

      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">Card Misuse by Cardholder</strong>.
Charges that involve misuse or abuse by the CH are not disputable
with the servicing bank. If the transaction was processed in
accordance with established controls (e.g., within the purchase
limits, not from a merchant with a blocked Merchant Category Code,
then the bank has fulfilled its responsibilities under the
contract, and the Government is obligated to make payment for the
transaction. The Government will take appropriate action, as
prescribed in Chapter 11, Disciplinary actions, to seek restitution
because of the improper misuse or abuse.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Sales Tax</strong>. If a charge
involves sales tax erroneously invoiced by the merchant, the amount
of the tax cannot be disputed with the bank. The CH should try to
obtain a credit from the merchant. If a credit is not obtained, the
CH should inform and request assistance from the A/OPC. The CH
should seek restitution via the guidance provided by the <a class="xref" href="https://smartpay.gsa.gov/smarttax/tax-information-by-state/" target="_blank">
            <u class="ph u">GSA
SmartPay Tax Exemption website</u>.</a> The CH should document the
file accordingly.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Shipping Costs</strong>. If a charge
involves shipping costs erroneously invoiced by the merchant, the
amount of the erroneous shipping costs cannot be disputed. The CH
should try to obtain a credit for the transportation costs from the
merchant. If a credit is not obtained, the CH should inform and
request assistance from the servicing bank. The CH should document
the file accordingly.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Convenience Checks</strong>. There is
no convenience check dispute process within the bank. Any concerns
with a purchase made by check must be resolved directly with the
merchant. The checkwriter is responsible for securing restitution
and/or credit for disputed purchases. The checkwriter will notify
the A/OPC and request assistance to resolve disputes if necessary.
Each organization is responsible for checks written on the account,
unless it is determined fraudulent activity is involved.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Third-party Payments</strong>. If a
dispute with a merchant involves a third-party payer (e.g., Google
Pay, PayPal), the dispute is not with the third-party payer, but
with the merchant. The bank has no privity to the transaction, and
the CH must resolve the dispute with the merchant and/or the credit
card company.</p>

      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. BOs must review LOAs selected by the CH as part
of the review, reconciliation, and certification process. Payments
are generally rejected because of missing or incorrect LOAs. The
Army’s financial management system will also reject missing
or incorrect LOAs, requiring the finance office to make corrections
or complete a manual payment in the system. When this happens, the
A/OPC will notify the BO when a payment has been rejected in the
system. The BO must immediately contact their RM for assistance in
obligating funds in the system and processing the manual payment.
For GFEBS-funded accounts, follow the GFEBS manual payment
process.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Steps for processing manual payments

        <p class="p List2">3) The BO may obtain the document control number
for each transaction by running the Standard Document Number report
from the bank’s EAS (located under Custom Reports).</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) After the document control number is applied,
the BO must forward the request for commitment, obligation, and

      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. GPC transaction documentation must be retained
for six years in accordance with FAR 4.805. Billing officials are
responsible for ensuring that record retention requirements are

must follow the retention guidance in DoD FMR Volume 15, Chapter 6,
and ensure the FMS documents are retained for 10 years from the
date of final case closure.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Uploading Supporting
Documentation</strong>. CHs must upload all transaction supporting
documentation in the bank’s EAS. The uploaded documentation
is the CH’s official purchase file. If the complete file is
uploaded in the EAS, CHs do not need to maintain a duplicate
hardcopy or electronic file. For purchases that do not have
uploaded documentation, the CH or BO must retain the corresponding

can be found at <a class="xref" href="http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/grs.html" target="_blank">http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/grs.html</a>.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Procedures must consider documents held in all
types of media, including microfilm and various electronic
media.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) The Army may change the original medium to
facilitate storage if the requirements of the FAR 4.8, law, and
other regulations are satisfied.</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) The process used to create and store records
must record and reproduce the original document, including
signatures and other written and graphic images completely,
accurately, and clearly.</p>
        <p class="p List2">6) Data transfer, storage, and retrieval
procedures must protect the original data from alteration. Unless
law or other regulations require signed originals to be kept, they
may be destroyed after the responsible agency official verifies
that record copies on alternate media and copies reproduced from
the record copy are accurate, complete, and clear representations
of the originals.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. Original disbursing office records, along with
CH supporting documents in electronic format, negate the need for
the CH to store duplicate hardcopy documents.</p>
        <p class="p List1">f. Electronic record storage requires adequate
controls to ensure the digital images accurately represent the
corresponding paper documentation and to detect changes to an
original digital image. In addition, electronic storage must be in
a centrally managed location that has an established backup
process.</p>
        <p class="p List1">g. See 6-2.g. for GPC transaction documentation
and disbursing office records. For additional examples of documents
classified as disbursing office records, see DoD FMR Volume 5,
Chapter 15, 150803.</p>
        <p class="p List1">h. Receipts are considered supporting documents
for the certified billing statement. Original receipts are
preferred; however, printed electronic forms or copies of an
itemized receipt are acceptable. The receipt must be legible and
indicate vendor’s name and address, date of the purchase, and
paid by credit card or zero amount due. Goods must be
itemized/detailed with the item description, quantity, price, and
extended price. The BO maintains these records electronically. The
CH and BO may rely on the servicing bank’s EAS for supporting
documentation. Original records are considered Government property
and may not be removed from Government control by the BO for any
reason.</p>
        <p class="p List1">i. <strong class="ph b">Appointment Letters</strong>.
Delegation of authority letters and GPC appointment letters,

Services</h3>
      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. The GPC may be used to purchase non-personal
services up to the applicable MPT, whether recurring or
non-recurring. If recurring, the requirement is the total estimated
cost per fiscal year. Recurring services estimated to exceed the
MPT per fiscal year will be acquired through the contracting
office. Recurring services are performed at regular intervals and
have a demand that can be accurately predicted on a yearly basis.
Non-recurring services involve one-time, unpredictable, or
occasional requirements, and may be purchased with the GPC up to
the MPT whenever a requirement occurs.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. When a CH receives a request to purchase
services, it is crucial to identify if the services are subject to
the Service Contract Labor Standards (SCLS) and determine the
applicable MPT.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Services Subject to Service Contract
Labor Standards</strong>. Examples include services performed by
carpenters, electricians, mechanics, plumbers, iron workers,
craftsmen, operating engineers, and other laborers. Other examples
include court reporters, administrative assistants, engineering
technicians, and paralegals. To determine whether a service is
subject to SCLS, CHs and A/OPCs can search the Service Contract Act
wage determinations in SAM.gov to locate a list of applicable
occupations for a specified state and county.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Services Not Subject to Service
Contract Labor Standards</strong>. The following services are not
subject to SCLS:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) <strong class="ph b">Professional Services</strong>.
Examples include services performed by architects, engineers,
professors, chemists, lawyers, doctors of medicine or dentistry,
and software engineers. These services may include office work
related to operations, teaching, practice of law or medicine, and
skilled services such as computer services, sales, and business
management. The primary duty must be the performance of work by
persons requiring knowledge of an advanced type in a field of
science or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of
specialized intellectual instruction or the performance of work
requiring invention, imagination, originality, or talent in a
recognized field of artistic or creative endeavor. If unsure, CHs

List</a> supplies directly from AbilityOne or from one of their
authorized distributors to satisfy the mandatory
requirement. CHs should first shop at their respective local
AbilityOne® Base Supply Center (BSC), where such stores exist.
AbilityOne profits are maximized for purchases made directly from
AbilityOne, such as a BSC or an AbilityOne online catalog. The
AbilityOne producing agency sells the supply at a set price (fair
market value). The distributor can sell the supply at varying
prices but is not allowed to sell below the fair market value.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. If FPI/UNICOR and AbilityOne participating
nonprofit agencies produce identical supplies or services,
FPI/UNICOR is the higher priority for supplies and AbilityOne is
the higher priority for services (FAR 8.603 and 8.002). Unlike
FPI/UNICOR procedures, AbilityOne purchasing procedures are
applicable to all purchases regardless of dollar value and do not
allow contracting officers to authorize purchase from an alternate
source. If the requirement can be fulfilled with an AbilityOne

      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. In accordance with FAR 8.004, CHs should
consider use of non-mandatory sources such as FSS contracts/BPAs
(e.g., GSA Advantage); Governmentwide acquisition contracts;
multi-Component contracts (e.g., DoD FedMall contracts), and
commercial sources in the open market (including educational and
nonprofit institutions).</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. When purchasing against a BPA, CHs will ensure
the requirements of FAR 13.303-5 are met. When purchasing against
an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contract, CHs will
follow the ordering procedures as specified by the contracting
officer and FAR Part 16. When purchasing against a FSS contract,
CHs will follow the ordering procedures at FAR 8.405. CHs will
attempt to distribute FSS orders among contractors that can meet
the Army’s need in accordance with FAR 8.405-1(b).</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Small Businesses</strong>. In
accordance with FAR 19.203, the requirement to set aside
acquisitions for small businesses does not apply to purchases
valued at or below the MPT. However, in accordance with FAR 19.201,
CHs should consider small businesses and socioeconomic programs to
the maximum extent practicable when using the GPC for purchases at
or below the MPT.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">General Services Administration (GSA)
Programs.</strong> GSA maintains the Federal Supply Schedule
program, also known as the GSA Schedules Program or the Multiple
Award Schedule Program. GSA offers an online shopping service
called GSA Advantage! through which CHs may place orders against
Schedules. CHs may also use GSA Advantage! to place orders through
GSA’s Global Supply System, a GSA wholesale supply source,
formerly known as "GSA Stock" or the "Customer Supply Center." GSA
Advantage! enables CHs to search specific information (e.g.,
national stock number, part number, common name), review delivery
options, place orders directly with Schedule contractors, and pay
for orders using the GPC. CHs may place orders up to the MPT with
any FSS contractor that can meet the agency’s needs. Although
not required to solicit from a specific number of schedule
contractors, ordering activities should attempt to distribute
orders among contractors. Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative
(FSSI) agreements are accessible at FSSI. Cardholders must consider
GSA’s commercial platforms before using commercial
sources.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">FedMall.</strong> FedMall is a
Government e-commerce acquisition platform which may be used for
procuring supplies beyond those listed in Section 8-1. CHs who use
FedMall are required to register for a FedMall account. To
register, CHs will need to know their DoDAAC or their Activity
Address Code (AAC). If FedMall does not recognize the CH’s
DoDAAC or AAC, CHs should contact their A/OPC to request the
contracting office’s Procurement DoDAAC for registration.
FedMall is accessible through the CH’s PIEE account via the
FedMall icon.</p>
        <p class="p List1">f. <strong class="ph b">Commercial Sources.</strong> Before
buying from a commercial source, CHs must review applicable
mandatory sources and non-mandatory Government sources. See Tables
9-1 and 9-2. Cardholders should rotate commercial sources.
Cardholders may purchase from a commercial source if the requested
supplies or services are unavailable from the applicable mandatory
source provided they obtain the appropriate waivers.</p>

        <p class="p List2">1) Requires that sustainable supplies and services
be considered as the first choice for all procurements,</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Assigns responsibility to virtually every DoD

      <span class="ph autonumber">9-10.</span> Commercial Platforms</h3>
      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. An e-marketplace platform is an online platform
where CHs can evaluate and order products via a portal operated by
a vendor: the portal provider. The e-marketplace platforms can
offer portal provider products and/or third-party vendor products.
Portal providers and third-party vendors are generally responsible
for fulfilling orders for their respective products. The
e-marketplace model encourages robust competition not only at the
platform level by offering millions of products across thousands of
suppliers, but also at the product level, with multiple suppliers
competing to sell a given product.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <a class="xref" href="https://www.gsa.gov/buy-through-us/purchasing-programs/commercial-platforms" target="_blank">GSA’s
Commercial Platforms program</a> (also known as GSA’s
e-commerce platforms) provides a managed channel for open-market
purchases through select commercial online platforms.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. Third-party payment processor policy does not
apply to e-commerce platforms or brick-and-mortar merchants that do
not accept payment using third-party payment processors. In the
e-commerce space, this includes, at a minimum, those in GSA’s
Commercial Platforms program, and AmazonBusiness.com. If a platform
changes their payment practices and begins allowing use of
third-party payment processors, the Army will validate each
applicable e-commerce platform continues to disallow use of
third-party payment processors. This revalidation will occur at
least semi-annually, to include notifying GPC oversight personnel
and CHs whether the applicable e-commerce platform does
not/continues not to accept payment using third party payment
processors.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">E-Marketplace Platform Method of
Payment</strong>. The GPC is the only authorized method of payment
for purchases placed on the e-marketplace platforms. Cardholders
are not allowed to use any other forms of payment, including
third-party payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Venmo, Google Wallet,
WePay) or payments using any form of cryptocurrency.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Compliance with AbilityOne</strong>.
Mandatory sources such as AbilityOne are effectively represented
and promoted in this program. Rather than simply state that
e-marketplaces are required to “block and sub” the
commercial item for the AbilityOne item, GSA requires platform
providers to prevent the sale of a commercial item which is
“essentially the same” as an item on the AbilityOne
Procurement List. In addition, GSA requires platform providers to
ensure the vendors selling AbilityOne products are, in fact,
authorized distributors.</p>
        <p class="p List1">f. <strong class="ph b">Data Visibility</strong>. Identifying
leakage through the commercial platforms will allow the Army the
ability to identify purchases that could be going to AbilityOne
distributors, small business suppliers, excluded entities, or spend
outside of strategic or mandatory-use agency contracts. This data
then allows the Army to take the necessary action to appropriately
manage this spend. Spend data is available to the Army through
on-demand reports and dashboards, allowing the Army to see
line-level spend from all e-marketplace platforms. Cardholders also
have real-time, account level access to their purchasing data
through the e-marketplace platforms for purchase card
reconciliation and spend analysis.</p>

      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. Convenience checks provide activities with the
flexibility to issue checks for payment of supplies and services to
support mission needs when the vendor doesn’t accept payment
by GPC. The Army does not receive refunds or retain dispute rights
on convenience check purchases. The authority to maintain a
convenience check account will be justified on an individual basis.
The number of convenience check accounts per installation must be
kept to a minimum. Convenience check accounts are available only to
organizations that maintain active GPC accounts in good
standing.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. Convenience checks must not be used to avoid
the normal GPC payment process. Before a check is issued, the
paying agency must make every effort to use the GPC, including
making maximum efforts to find and use merchants that accept the
GPC. Before writing a convenience check, the checkwriter must
obtain an IRS Form W-9 to ensure possession of all information
required for tax form issuance.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. DFAS recommends not writing checks to foreign
vendors. When writing a check to a foreign vendor, an IRS Form W-8
is required before payment. To determine which W-8 form is used,
see IRS Publication 515, Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens
and Foreign Entities. To determine if tax withholding and tax
deposits to the IRS are required, see IRS Publication 515,
Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Entities
and/or IRS Publication 901, U.S. Tax Treaties.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. If a U.S. vendor refuses to provide their TIN
and it is a tax reportable payment, the checkwriter will choose
another vendor.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Restrictions</strong>.</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Checkwriters must not use checks for employee
reimbursements, cash advances, cash awards, travel-related
transportation payments, or meals.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Convenience check purchases must not require
detailed specifications or an inspection report.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Convenience checks should not be used for
recurring payments.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Convenience checks must not be used as a method
of payment against existing contract instruments.</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) Checks will not be issued as an
“exchange-for-cash” vehicle to establish cash funds. If
merchants issue credits or refunds by cash or check, the funds must
be immediately credited to the account against which the purchase
was originally made.</p>
        <p class="p List2">6) The same purchase prohibitions that apply to
the GPC apply to convenience checks.</p>
        <p class="p List1">f. <strong class="ph b">Micro-purchase Threshold</strong>. The
MPT for convenience checks is half the open market and contingency
MPT per Section 806 of Public Law 115-91. See Table 1-2. Splitting
payments across multiple checks is prohibited if the total
requirement will exceed the applicable convenience check MPT.
Checkwriters may use checks for purchases in support of declared
contingency events up to the applicable convenience check MPT.</p>
        <p class="p List1">g. <strong class="ph b">Processing Fee</strong>. Convenience
checks must be written for the exact payment amount. The payment
amount for a check does not include the servicing bank’s
administrative processing fee. The check processing fee is added by
the servicing bank during processing of the transaction, and the
addition of the processing fee is not considered a split
requirement. Checkwriters should ensure that the total funds
obligated include both the payment amount and the processing fee.
The convenience check MPT is for the payment amount of the good or
service, which does not include the processing fee (e.g., a check
may be written up to $5,000; the processing fee is accounted for
separately and is charged separately on the billing statement).</p>
        <p class="p List1">h. <strong class="ph b">Security and Oversight</strong>.
Convenience checks are negotiable instruments and must be stored in
a locked container, such as a safe or locking filing cabinet.
Checks must be accounted for appropriately to prevent loss, theft,
or potential forgery. Review convenience check accounts annually.
Accounts with checks written above the allowable limit will be
subject to suspension or termination. Commands with oversight
responsibility will consider cancellation of convenience check
privileges of cardholders who improperly use convenience checks
(e.g., exceeding the convenience check limit).</p>
        <p class="p List1">i. Convenience checks are pre-numbered, and their
use is controlled with a separate convenience check purchase log
for each account. Check purchases are reconciled just as other GPC
transactions, as part of the monthly statement billing cycle in the
servicing bank’s EAS. Retain copies of voided checks in the
bank’s EAS as part of the file documentation.</p>
        <p class="p List1">j. <strong class="ph b">Disputes</strong>. The normal GPC
dispute process is not applicable to convenience checks. Concerns
over a check purchase must be resolved directly with the merchant.
The checkwriter is responsible for securing credits or resolving
problems with the merchant. Each organization is responsible for
all checks written on an account, unless it is determined fraud is
involved. In some cases, payments can be stopped on a convenience
check that has been written if the check has not yet been posted to
an account. To stop payment on a check, the checkwriter must call
the servicing bank’s customer service department to receive
instructions on processing the action.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">11-1.</span> Internal Controls</h3>
      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. Effective internal controls are essential to
reducing the risk inherent in the Army GPC Program and maintaining
its integrity and accountability. Internal controls are necessary
to ensure the achievement of organizational objectives; operational
effectiveness and efficiency; reliable financial reporting; and
compliance with laws, regulations, and policies. The Army has
established a series of automated and manual internal controls and
oversight procedures designed to identify and mitigate risk,
document the effectiveness of controls, and provide data to
effectively target corrective actions where and when needed.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. A key portion of the automated oversight
process, the SAHAR, provides the HCA/SCO with a high-level summary
of the scope, internal control effectiveness, level of risk, and
corrective actions implemented or required across the Army GPC
program. One of the major strengths of these controls and
procedures is the aggressive inclusion of automation applied to
control points, data-mining, and reporting that enforce laws,
regulation, and policy, reducing the administrative cost of
effective oversight.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. Automation is incorporated in the
control/oversight/reporting process through several integrated
applications sharing data throughout the entire process, from
automated identity verification and supervisor approval in PIEE, to
training reports from DAU to PIEE, to JAM appointments with
purchase limitations communicated to the card-issuing bank for
account establishment, to transaction information data-mined in
IOD, and automated reporting across the entire scope of the
process. This extensive automation increases the efficiency,
accuracy, auditability, and reliability of the oversight process
and the integrity and safety of the GPC Program.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. GPC management officials are responsible for
establishing a process of internal controls that (1) provides
reasonable assurance that the GPC program is used efficiently,
effectively, and legally to help manage the program and reduce
violations; and (2) complies with applicable laws and regulations.
Management should periodically review their GPC program’s
internal controls and avail themselves of the Monthly A/OPC Review
and SAHAR reports, along with any other reports, to ensure the
internal controls covered in specified reports are being followed
and GPC program participants are performing responsibly.</p>

Process</h3>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. Surveillance and oversight of the GPC program
are a shared responsibility. All stakeholders in the program,
including requiring offices, RMs, logistics, contracting, and local
audit and oversight organizations, are responsible for ensuring
that the GPC is used in the proper manner and only authorized and
necessary official purchases are made. Organizations should develop
and follow a monitoring and oversight plan that establishes
frequencies, methods, participation, etc.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. Oversight is conducted to:</p>
      <p class="p List2">1) Validate and promote compliance with existing
internal controls;</p>
      <p class="p List2">2) Identify, report, and resolve systemic material
program weaknesses; and</p>
      <p class="p List2">3) Measure the effectiveness of internal
controls.</p>
      <p class="p List1">c. To improve auditability of GPC program
oversight and realize the cost and other benefits of using the
commercially available SP3 technology, DoD uses the integrated
three-pronged, system-enabled review cycle depicted in Figure
11-1.</p>

         <img class="image" src="Graphics/image3.png" alt="Text Description automatically generated"> 
      </p>
      <p class="p List1">d. The three-pronged review cycle supplements
existing GPC operational transaction management and account
reconciliation and review processes, including:</p>
      <p class="p List2">1) Cardholder-obtained purchasing approvals (e.g.,
BO pre-purchase approval, special item approval, availability of
appropriate and sufficient funds);</p>
      <p class="p List2">2) Cardholder matching and approval of orders to
transactions and monthly statement approval;</p>
      <p class="p List2">3) Billing official monthly certification of the
managing account billing statement;</p>
      <p class="p List2">4) Resource manager funds certification;</p>
      <p class="p List2">5) A/OPC ongoing oversight and policy compliance
efforts; and</p>
      <p class="p List2">6) Disbursing office funds validation and
disbursement processing.</p>
      <p class="p">The cycle also supplements and informs both the periodic reviews
of Army contracting offices (e.g., Army PMRs or DCMA-led PMRs)
conducted to assess the effectiveness of the contracting function,
and the GPC governance processes conducted to evaluate and improve
the effectiveness of GPC internal controls.</p>
      <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Data analytics.</strong> Data analytics
is the application of electronic tools (software and/or systems)
for automated data sorting, filtering and mining techniques using
self-learning algorithms to search GPC transaction data in order to
identify patterns, trends, risks, opportunities and other
information. A/OPCs should use data analytics tools to assist them
in the management and oversight of their GPC program.</p>
      <p class="p List1">f. The Army uses preventive, detective, and
directive controls to monitor the GPC program.</p>
      <p class="p List2">1) Preventive controls are designed to discourage
errors or irregularities from occurring (e.g., processing a
transaction only after it has been properly approved by the
appropriate personnel).</p>
      <p class="p List2">2) Detective controls are designed to find errors
or irregularities after they have occurred (e.g., IOD data mining,
approving statements, and reconciling monthly invoices).</p>
      <p class="p List2">3) Directive controls are designed to encourage a
desirable event (e.g., written policies and procedures to assist in
compliance and the accomplishment of the goals and objectives of
the GPC program).</p>
      <p class="p List1">g. The HCA/SCO and A/OPCs are responsible for
adhering to the requirements specified in OMB Circular A-123,
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Control. The HCA/SCO
and A/OPCs are also responsible for adhering to the requirements
specified in 10 USC 4754 (as modified by Public Law 112–194,
Government Charge Card Abuse Prevention Act of 2012). These
statutory requirements mandate the following actions (list not
comprehensive):</p>
      <p class="p List2">1) Using effective systems, techniques, and
technologies to prevent or identify improper purchases.</p>
      <p class="p List2">2) Invalidating GPCs from each employee who ceases
to be employed by the Government or separates from Military
Service.</p>
      <p class="p List2">3) Taking steps to recover the cost of any
illegal, improper, or erroneous purchases made with a purchase card
or convenience check made by an employee or member of the armed
forces, including, as necessary, through salary offsets.</p>
      <p class="p List2">4) Taking appropriate adverse personnel actions or
imposing other punishments when employees of the Army violate
regulations governing the use and control of purchase cards and
convenience checks or who are negligent or engage in misuse, abuse,
or fraud with respect to a purchase card, including removal in
appropriate cases. Violations of such regulations by a person
subject to 10 USC Chapter 47, the Uniform Code of Military Justice
(UCMJ), is punishable as a violation of section 892 of article 92
of the UCMJ.</p>
      <p class="p List2">5) Requiring the Army Audit Agency to conduct
periodic audits or reviews of GPC programs to identify and analyze
risks of illegal, improper, or erroneous purchases and payments and
report the result to the Director of the OMB and Congress.</p>
      <p class="p List2">6) A/OPCs must provide monitoring, oversight,
training, and administration of all BOs and CHs. Supervisors and
BOs are responsible for the monitoring and oversight of BOs and CHs
under their purview.</p>
      <p class="p List1">h. To minimize losses to the Army, the program
must have an expectation of high integrity and ethical behavior
from all participants, and sufficient staff to perform the
following functions:</p>
      <p class="p List2">1) Conduct periodic risk assessments to identify
fraud, waste, and abuse and establish specific controls to
reasonably ensure that losses from these risks are minimized, to
include data mining.</p>
      <p class="p List2">2) Conduct proper training and complete reporting
and data analysis to ensure personnel have the skills and
information needed to be effective in their positions.</p>
      <p class="p List2">3) Conduct detailed, effective management and
oversight.</p>
      <p class="p List2">4) Implement corrective actions when cardholder
management is non-compliant with Army policies and procedures.</p>
      <p class="p List1">i. DPCAP will rely on the signed Semi-Annual HA
data provided by CPMs to accomplish DoD GPC reporting required by
OMB. DPCAP updates visual trending of statistical and violation
information to identify trends in GPC use and variances and shares
this information with the Army during the GPC CPM Monthly
Calls.</p>
      <p class="p List1">j. The GPC Integrated Solutions Team (IST) is
DoD’s GPC governance body. IST membership consists of a GPC
Governance Board composed of representatives from DPCAP, Army,
Navy, Air Force, other Defense agencies, and supported by the bank
team. The bank team consists of U.S. Bank (card-issuing bank),
MasterCard (card association), and Oversight Systems (data mining
vendor). The IST typically meets semi-annually to achieve the
following:</p>
      <p class="p List2">1) Review trends and changes in the GPC industry
and the DoD GPC Program.</p>
      <p class="p List2">2) Identify and approve any necessary adjustments
to the bank team's electronic capabilities, DoD’s GPC
enterprise tools, and/or DoD GPC policies.</p>
      <p class="p List2">3) Identify and approve changes to the DM rules
and system parameter settings.</p>
      <p class="p List2">4) Bring efficiencies to the Program by adjusting
the business rules/parameters based on transaction risk.</p>
      <p class="p List2">5) Review trends and changes in the GPC industry
and the DoD GPC Program.</p>
      <p class="p List2">6) Identify any necessary adjustments to the bank
team's electronic capabilities, DoD’s GPC enterprise tools,
and/or DoD GPC policies.</p>
      <p class="p List2">7) Identify and approving changes to the Data
Mining rules.</p>
      <p class="p List2">8) Review relevant data mining case information
and recommendations provided by the bank team (e.g., percentage of
data mining cases created for review; frequency with which each
rule is triggered and associated DM case disposition, and
information about the findings, determinations, and corrective
actions identified) and results of the Semi-Annual HA process to
inform its decision making.</p>

        <p class="p List1">a. Insights on Demand (IOD) is the SmartPay®3
data mining (DM) tool used to monitor purchasing activity and
perform oversight functions. IOD provides the capabilities to
identify high-risk transactions and unusual spending patterns; scan
purchasing activity for misuse, fraud, waste, and abuse; and flag
transactions for review. Instructions on how to navigate and
perform functions in IOD are in the servicing bank’s IOD user
guides and in the <a class="xref" href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/asda/dpc/ce/index.html" target="_blank">

Systems’ IOD DM capability evaluates each transaction against
a set of tiered business rules to identify high-risk transactions.
Tier 1 rules are mandatory and applicable to all DoD purchase
cards. Tier 2 rules are mandatory rules that can be tailored as
necessary at the local level. DM cases can be system-generated or
manually generated. The system generates a DM case whenever a
business rule is broken. GPC program officials are required to
manually create cases for each finding and disciplinary category
determination they independently identify during their reviews.
Each case is adjudicated to determine if the transaction is to be
classified under one of five disciplinary categories standardized
in compliance with the DPCAP memo “Final Governmentwide
Commercial Purchase Card Disciplinary Category Definitions
Guidance,” January 27, 2020. Disputes are also categorized as
determinations.</p>
      <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Tier 2 Tailoring</strong>. Tier 2
business rules are tailorable to meet the Army’s
organizational needs. Tailoring must be consistent with
requirements in the DoD Charge Card Guidebook. As part of the SAHAR
process, HAs are required to validate that any Tier 2 Tailoring of
DM business rules are implemented appropriately. For more
information, refer to GPC one-pager 3OP034, “Tier 2 Tailoring
in Insights on Demand (IOD)” on the DPCAP GPC website. To
properly manage program risk for these potentially high-risk
transactions, IOD automatically selects a random sample of 1% of
these Tier 2 “auto closed” cases and assigns them for
adjudication (“1% Random Reopen”). The IST reviews Tier
2 Tailoring data sets and trends and considers methodology changes
based on its findings.</p>
      <p class="p">c. <strong class="ph b">Case Assignment and Review Process</strong>.</p>
      <p class="p List2">1) IOD flags a transaction for review, generates a
case, and assigns it to the primary BO.</p>
      <p class="p List2">2) The BO reviews the CH’s file
documentation per section 6-2.g. The BO then locates the case in
IOD and inputs requested data.</p>
      <p class="p List2">3) After the BO submits their review, IOD assigns
the case to the Level 4 A/OPC. The Level 4 A/OPC reviews the
CH’s file documentation, inputs comments about the purchase,
identifies the applicable finding, and closes the case. The
comments should provide information about the transaction and a
detailed explanation of any findings. For administrative findings,
the comments must state what documents or signatures were
missing.</p>

        <p class="p">A/OPCs and CPMs must complete monthly reviews within IOD to
promote and measure compliance with internal controls and provide
reasonable assurance of the effectiveness of these controls to
mitigate program risk. A/OPCs and CPMs are required to complete
monthly reviews each billing cycle. IOD automatically assigns and
generates monthly reviews, which become available for completion
once all transactions for that agent and billing cycle have been
closed. Monthly reviews are considered complete only if 100 percent
of all cases selected during the billing cycle have been
closed.</p>
        <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">A/OPC Monthly Review</strong>. Level 4
A/OPCs must complete this review once all BOs have completed all
cases assigned to them. A/OPCs are required to initiate and conduct
a Monthly A/OPC Review at the end of each billing cycle. To
complete the A/OPC Monthly Review, you must generate the Monthly
A/OPC Review Report to assess the key internal controls. Within 30
days of the cycle end date, A/OPCs must complete the following
actions:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Validate all DM cases (except those in a
deployed or exempt status) are closed.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Generate the Monthly A/OPC Review Report in IOD
and assess the key internal controls included on the report. Key
GPC program controls are calculated and displayed in the Monthly
A/OPC Review Report generated by the DM tool. See the <a class="xref" href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/asda/dpc/ce/pc/docs/smart-pay/Monthly_Report_Guide.pdf" target="_blank">Monthly
A/OPC Review Report Guide</a>, which addresses data sources,
calculation methodologies, and report format.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Perform a summary assessment that includes 100
percent of all transactions not flagged by the DM tool to (1)
ensure awareness of purchasing activity within their hierarchy and
(2) identify purchasing and behavior patterns not otherwise
identified by the DM tool (e.g., patterns that span multiple card
accounts and/or MAs) or that may otherwise require A/OPC action.
Access Online Transaction Detail reports are available for
performing these reviews.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Ensure a DM case is created for each Finding
and Determination they independently identify (i.e., not flagged by
the DM tool).</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) Document completion of the review by completing
and certifying the A/OPC Monthly Checklist. Upload the Monthly
A/OPC Review Report in the Messages tab of the A/OPC Monthly
Review. If a Level 4 A/OPC has multiple agents, they can run one
report for all agents and upload it to the top-listed level.</p>

planned or taken. Level 3 A/OPCs are also required to spot-check
the monthly reviews conducted by their Level 4 A/OPCs. Level 3
A/OPCs will complete monthly reviews within 10 calendar days of
their Level 4 A/OPCs’ completion.</p>

(i.e., is deferred) using the DM tool because the BO and/or A/OPC
and their alternates are deployed or exempt and have insufficient
access to the application, the OA/OPC may then mark the case
“Closed – Not Reviewed” in the DM tool and
approve completion of the monthly review cycle. The BO and/or A/OPC
will complete the monthly review manually and then update the audit

GPC Violations</h3>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p List1">a. The Disciplinary Category Definitions Policy
has been established to foster consistency across DoD. These
definitions are defined in and required by the <a class="xref" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Issuance-of-Revised-Appendix-B-to-OMB-Circular-A-123.pdf" target="_blank">OMB
Circular A-123</a> to ensure accurate and complete reporting. All
the disciplinary categories are reportable to DPCAP. The first four
(abuse, internal fraud, misuse, and delinquency) are violations.
The latter two (administrative discrepancy and external fraud),
while disciplinary categories, are not violations.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_11-7__Table111">b. Of the categories of defined DoD GPC
violations, abuse and internal fraud are considered more serious
than the other categories, as they are intentional in nature.
Misuse is considered unintentional. Intent is not applicable to
infrequent delinquencies, as the determination of such violations
is strictly quantitative (i.e., all undisputed account balances
that are unpaid for more than 61 days past the statement date). Figure 11-2 depicts the
decision framework to be used when determining which violation
category is applicable.</p>

      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">Fraud can be defined as a deception deliberately practiced with
the motive of securing unfair or unlawful gain. Fraud can be an
attempt to cheat the Federal Government and corrupt its CHs by
using GPC accounts for transactions not part of official Government
business. Fraud can come in many disguises, such as false emails,
mail, or phone calls. The following are the three primary
categories of fraud:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) <strong class="ph b">Non-cardholder Fraud</strong>.
Examples: Lost or stolen card, account takeover, and identity
theft.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) <strong class="ph b">Cardholder Fraud</strong>. Examples:
Kickbacks, falsified transactions, and false statements.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) <strong class="ph b">Merchant Fraud</strong>. Examples:
False transactions, intentional mischarges, bribes, and
gratuities.</p>

      <h3 class="title topictitle3" id="ariaid-title106">
      <span class="ph autonumber">11-9.</span> Non-Cardholder Fraud</h3>
      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. Non-cardholder fraud involves the use of the
card account or CH data by an unauthorized person. Non-cardholder
fraud is investigated by special units within the servicing bank.
Any information acquired relating to non-cardholder fraud should be
reported. The risk of non-cardholder fraud is higher in the
following situations:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) <strong class="ph b">Account/Card never received</strong>. A
new or replacement card has been mailed to the CH but was not
received. This may be due to a third-party interception. In this
case, the account should be cancelled, and new card issued.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) <strong class="ph b">Lost or Stolen Account/Card</strong>.
If the CH reports the account as lost or stolen, the account will
be cancelled and new one issued. Reporting the account as lost or
stolen does not relieve the Federal Government for payment for any
transactions that were made by the account holder prior to losing
it.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) <strong class="ph b">Altered or counterfeit cards</strong>.
This occurs when third parties obtain account information and used
that information to make purchases with an altered or counterfeit
card. If the bank recognizes a fraudulent pattern of use at the
time of authorization, the bank will validate the use of the
account with the CH and/or suspend the account.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) <strong class="ph b">Account takeover/ Identity
theft</strong>. In this case, the account holder’s identity
has been compromised and a third party has requested a new account
by providing confidential information about the account holder. Any
CH who believes that he or she may have been subject to identity
theft should contact the bank’s customer-service department.
Once a determination is made that an account has been compromised,
investigation is the responsibility of the bank. Unless a
government employee is determined to be involved in the fraud, the
agency generally does not participate in the investigation. The
account will be closed, and a replacement account opened.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">If Non-Cardholder Fraud
Occurs</strong>. If fraud is detected on the account, the CH must
immediately report the incident to the following: BO, A/OPC and
servicing bank. The servicing bank will block and/or terminate the
account. If necessary, the bank will then issue a new card with a
new account number. Also, the bank will mail a “Statement of
Fraud” letter to the cardholder, which must be completed and
returned promptly. Sometimes, unauthorized transactions will appear
on the billing statement, even though the account was reported lost
or stolen. Cardholders should report all unauthorized transactions
by calling the bank's customer service telephone number.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Non-Cardholder Fraud Methods</strong>.
Some of the different methods of fraud include the following:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) <strong class="ph b">Counterfeit Accounts</strong>. To make
fake cards, criminals use the newest technology to
“skim” information contained on magnetic stripes of
cards and also to pass security features (such as holograms).</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) <strong class="ph b">Lost or Stolen Accounts</strong>.
Physical cards are stolen from a workplace, gym or unattended
vehicle.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) <strong class="ph b">Card Not Present.</strong> Internet
fraud occurs whenever account information is stolen and used to
make online purchases. Merchant asks for the CVC code (located on
the back of the card) to help prevent this type of fraud.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) <strong class="ph b">Phishing</strong>. Phishing occurs
whenever a CH receives a fake email directing him or her to enter
sensitive personal information on a phony website. The false
website enables the criminal to steal information from the account
holder.</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) <strong class="ph b">Non-Receipt</strong>. This type of
fraud occurs whenever new or replacement cards are mailed and then
stolen while in transit.</p>
        <p class="p List2">6) <strong class="ph b">Identity Theft</strong>. A criminal
applies for an account using another person’s identity and
information.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Detecting Non-Cardholder
Fraud</strong>. One of the first signs that an individual is a
victim of fraud is at least one “mystery expense”
showing up in the monthly statement. To help detect fraud,
cardholders should review their statement by performing the
following actions:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Look for transactions you do not recall
making.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Check for unknown vendors.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Search for account withdrawals you do not
remember making.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Avoiding Non-Cardholder Fraud</strong>.
Cardholders should use the following practices to avoid fraud:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Secure account number and information.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Safeguard your personal identification number
(PIN). Do not write it down; memorize it. Do not share your
PIN.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Monitor your card during transactions. When the
card is returned, check to make sure it is yours.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Immediately report lost or stolen accounts
and/or any questionable charges.</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) Sign the back of a new card as soon as you
receive it. If you do not receive a replacement card before the
expiration date of the older card, contact the bank.</p>
        <p class="p List2">6) Destroy unwanted or expired cards. Shred or
secure monthly statements and receipts.</p>
        <p class="p List2">7) Electronically verify charges appearing on your
monthly statement.</p>
        <p class="p List2">8) Unless you initiated the purchase, never give
your account information over the telephone, through the mail, or
on the internet.</p>
        <p class="p List2">9) Consistently check your account for accuracy of
personal and billing information. Notify the bank if your personal
information and/or address needs updating.</p>
        <p class="p List2">10) Never let a telemarketer or salesperson
pressure you into agreeing to a deal.</p>
        <p class="p List2">11) Be aware of common scams and contact your
A/OPC and the bank for unusual situations.</p>
        <p class="p List2">12) Inform your A/OPC if you won’t be using
your card for an extended time. The A/OPC will temporarily suspend
the card or reduce the single purchase limit to $1.</p>

Fraud</h3>
      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">Cardholder Fraud, Misuse and
Abuse</strong>. This type of fraud occurs when a cardholder uses
their account to transact business that is not sanctioned, not
authorized, not in one’s official Government capacity, not
for the purpose for which the card was issued, and/or not as part
of official Government business. Intentional use of a GPC account
for other than official Government business constitutes abuse, and
depending on the situation, may constitute fraud.</p>
        <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_11-10__Figure_11-2_Violation_Category_Decision">b.
<strong class="ph b">Consequences of Cardholder Fraud</strong>. Cardholders have
a responsibility to use the account to procure supplies and
services at the direction of the Army under official purchase
authorization. If a CH abuses the GPC or participates in fraud, the
Army may cancel the purchase account and take appropriate
disciplinary action against the CH. In the case of account abuse,
any participating employee may be held personally liable to the
Federal Government for the amount of any unauthorized transaction.
Depending on the facts involved, an employee may be subject to fine
or imprisonment for action relating to purchase account abuse and
fraud. There are guidelines and procedures for disciplinary action
to be taken against individuals for the improper, fraudulent, or
abusive use of the purchase account. Purchase account abuse/fraud
may have the following potential consequences:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Counseling</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Cancellation of card account</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Notation in employee performance evaluation</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Reprimand</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) Suspension of employment</p>
        <p class="p List2">6) Termination of employment</p>
        <p class="p List2">7) Criminal prosecution</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">If Cardholder Fraud Occurs</strong>. If
an A/OPC suspects that a BO or CH has committed fraud, the A/OPC
should first contact the individual’s command. The A/OPC may
file a complaint with the Army Inspector General. Investigations
are initiated upon receipt of a complaint or other information that
gives a reasonable account of the wrongful or fraudulent act. The
DoD hotline phone number is 800-424-9098 to report fraud. A/OPCs
should be as specific as possible when reporting fraud. The
following information should be provided:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Employee's full name</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Rank or pay grade</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Duty station</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Specific suspected fraudulent act or
wrongdoing</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) Specific dates and times</p>
        <p class="p List2">6) Specific location of where the suspected
fraudulent act occurred</p>
        <p class="p List2">7) How the individual completed the alleged
fraudulent act</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Merchant Fraud</strong>. This type of
fraud is committed by the merchant. Merchant fraud can occur either
with or without the CH’s knowledge or consent. Rotating
sources may help prevent this type of fraud. Billing errors, such
as duplicate charges, are not considered merchant fraud. Examples
include:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) A vendor intentionally charges for items not
delivered/services not performed.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) A vendor offers bribes and gratuities to a
government employee in exchange for gaining purchasing
activity.</p>

Fraud</h3>
      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">Reports for Identifying and Preventing
Fraud</strong>. A/OPCs should use the following reports to identify
potential card misuse and fraud and to prevent fraud from
occurring:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) <strong class="ph b">Declined Transaction Authorizations
Report</strong>. This report identifies cardholders who have
attempted to use an account to buy an item for which they are not
authorized, that exceeds their single purchase limit, that exceeds
their monthly purchase limit, or from a merchant that falls under a
blocked MCC.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) <strong class="ph b">Transaction Detail Report</strong>.
This report identifies the date, merchant, reason code, dollar
amount, and status of each dispute filed by CH. BOs and A/OPCs
should track and follow up on disputes to determine their outcomes.
Cardholders should attempt to resolve disputes directly with
merchants prior to filing a disputes report. If a merchant is
consistently appearing on the disputes report, the A/OPC should
determine whether the merchant may have billing issues, quality
issues, or is attempting to commit fraud by submitting false
transactions.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) <strong class="ph b">Unusual Spending Activity
Report</strong>. This report identifies transactions that may
warrant further review.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) <strong class="ph b">Account Status Change Report.</strong>
This report lists accounts with a change status of lost/stolen,
closed, or reopened accounts. This status may either be an
indicator that the CH needs to secure the account or that the CH is
attempting to disguise misuse or fraudulent activity by denying the
charges.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Reporting Fraud</strong>. All
identified instances of suspected fraud or abuse must be reported.
Various channels of reporting include the Chain of Command, the
A/OPC, the command’s procurement fraud advisor (Staff/Command
Judge Advocate), the servicing Criminal Investigation Division
office, internal review organizations, and Inspector Generals at
all levels. Notify the CH’s commander or second-line
supervisor, as appropriate, and security manager when a Defense
criminal investigative organization or Defense organizational
element responsible for investigating potential misconduct
involving the GPC initiates an investigation into allegations of
charge card violations. Whenever possible, this notification should
take place within 72 hours of the initiation. See DoD Charge Card
Guidebook A.1.11.</p>

one or more of the following corrective actions:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Document the purchase violation in IOD and the
purchase file.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Require involved parties to attend

        <p class="p List2">4) Suspend CH or BO account.</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) Terminate CH or BO appointment and account.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Continual or Severe
Violations</strong>. Continual violation of GPC procedures by a CH
or BO will result in termination of GPC privileges. A/OPCs will
document the violation and action taken in their files for that
particular CH/BO. A/OPCs will refer evidence of deliberate abuse to
the CH and/or BO’s supervisor, Commander, or SCO for
appropriate action in accordance with the Uniform Code of Military
Justice or civilian disciplinary rules. A/OPCs will refer evidence
of internal fraud or other criminal activity to the Commander or

adopted use of the group term Emergency-Type Operations (ETOs) in
contingency contracting and GPC policy. The ETOs currently included
in 41 USC 1903 are the following:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Contingency Operations as defined in FAR
2.101;</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Operations to facilitate the defense against or
recovery from cyber, nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological
attack against the United States as addressed in FAR 18.001;</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Operations in support of a request from the
Secretary of State or the Administrator of the United States Agency
for International Development to facilitate the provision of
international disaster assistance as addressed in FAR 18.001;
and</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Operations to support response to an emergency
or major disaster as defined in Section 102 of the <a class="xref" href="https://www.fema.gov/disaster/stafford-act" target="_blank">
            <u class="ph u">Robert T.
Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act</u>
          </a> (42
USC 5121, implemented in FAR Subpart 26.2).</p>
        <p class="p">
The term ETO also includes humanitarian or peacekeeping operations
as defined in FAR 2.101. Currently, when supporting humanitarian or
peacekeeping operations, the MPT does not increase, regardless of
whether the humanitarian or peacekeeping operation is taking place
inside or outside the United States; and the SAT can increase to
$500,000 upon determination by the HCA that the respective supplies
or services directly support the humanitarian or peacekeeping
operation.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. FAR 18.2 addresses Emergency Acquisition
Flexibilities (EAFs). It is critical to verify whether increased
EAFs have been authorized for the particular ETO being supported.
If so, each HCA has the authority to authorize use of EAFs. The
primary EAF related to use of the GPC is the increased threshold
defined in paragraph (3) of the “Micro-Purchase
Threshold” definition at FAR 2.101. EAFs will be used only
for the duration of the ETO by those who have been authorized to
support the effort. Upon conclusion of the ETO authority, use of
EAFs will cease and purchasing limits will return to previous
levels. EAFs must be used solely for transactions that have a clear
and direct relationship with the ETO and that appropriate internal
controls are established and maintained to support and track use of
the increased flexibilities.</p>

formal designation or declaration to have been made or (2) certain
requirements to have been met. Policy on the use of EAFs can be

authorized by the cognizant HCA. It is important to note that DFARS
218.270 authorizes the HCA to make certain acquisition
determinations on behalf of the Agency Head. Table 12-1 shows the
increased MPTs in support of ETOs (excluding humanitarian and
peacekeeping operations) (see DFARS PGI 213.201). Cardholders
located inside the United States are prohibited from using the

      <span class="ph autonumber">14-1.</span> Authorized Purchases</h3>
      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. An authorized purchase satisfies a current
mission-related need at a fair and reasonable price that meets all
legal and regulatory requirements. It meets the following five
criteria:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) <strong class="ph b">Lawful</strong>. Purchase is funded and
authorized by law or regulation, and the requested item/service
fits the appropriation which is being used. See 48 CFR 13.301(a)
and 31 USC 1301(a).</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) <strong class="ph b">Legitimate Government Need</strong>.
Request is for official purposes and not for the personal benefit
of a government employee.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) <strong class="ph b">Bona Fide Need (Current Year
Appropriation)</strong>. Request is for the need of the current
year of the appropriation. This rule does not prevent maintaining a
legitimate inventory at reasonable and historical levels. See 31
USC 1502.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) <strong class="ph b">Minimum Needs of the
Government</strong>. Request should not exceed what is truly
required. See FAR 11.103(c)(1).</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) <strong class="ph b">Fair and Reasonable Price</strong>.
Price charged is fair to both parties, considering the quality and
timeliness of performance and delivery. Micro-purchases may be
awarded without seeking competitive quotes if the CH or BO
considers the price to be reasonable. Cardholders should obtain
multiple quotes if they suspect that the price is not reasonable or
if buying a supply/service for which no comparable pricing is
readily available. See FAR 13.203(a)(3).</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Funding</strong>. Funds must be
committed and obligated prior to purchase. BOs must ensure that
sufficient funds are obligated within the financial system before
providing approval to the CH to make the purchase. CHs must screen
the purchase request to verify the BO has approved the requirement
to make the purchase. For CHs who use GFEBS, a purchase request
with sufficient funding must have L4 approval before the card is
swiped.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Contract Payments</strong>. If a valid
procurement requirement has resulted in the award of a government
contract, the GPC may be used as a method of payment against the
contract, even if the acquisition would otherwise be for a GPC
prohibited item.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">14-2.</span> Unauthorized Commitments and
Ratification</h3>
      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. An unauthorized commitment (UAC) is defined by
FAR 1.602-3(a) as “an agreement that is not binding solely
because the Government representative who made it lacked the
authority to enter into that agreement on behalf of the
Government.” See AFARS 5101.602-3-90. The only individuals
who can bind the Government are warranted contracting officers,
ordering officials, and cardholders acting within the limits of
their delegated authority. The primary factor in determining
whether a purchase is considered a UAC is contracting authority.
CHs have this authority from their appointment letter. When an
individual without contracting authority initiates a purchase, it
is considered a UAC. The designated CH is the only person
authorized to make purchases with a GPC.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. Payment for goods or services accepted for an
UAC may be made only through the ratification process. Payment
cannot be made unless a Contracting Officer has awarded a contract
or an authorized GPC holder acting within his or her delegation of
authority has ordered the item(s).</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Examples of Unauthorized
Commitments</strong>.</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) The Army receives services/supplies in which a
properly executed funding document and an authorized procurement
method (e.g., contract, BPA, or GPC) was not established prior to
the Government ordering the services/supplies.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Someone other than the CH contacts a vendor and
asks them to provide supplies or perform work, without the
CH’s knowledge and without prior approval of the billing
official.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) An individual without contracting authority
orders supplies or services.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) CH orders supplies or services exceeding their
procurement authority.</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) A vendor mistakes a request for information as
an order, ships the item, the receiver does not realize it is an
improper order and accepts the item rather than rejecting and
returning the item.</p>
        <p class="p List2">6) A contractor continues to perform a service
contract or provide leased/rented equipment after the expiration
date of the contract. This situation frequently occurs on yearly
services/maintenance/lease-type contracts for which there is a
continuing need.</p>
        <p class="p List2">7) An individual makes a commitment for
continuation of services over and above the original scope and
dollar amount, or delivery of supplies under an expired contract,
purchase order, or delivery order.</p>
        <p class="p List2">8) An individual makes a commitment which exceeds
the call order limit on a BPA.</p>
        <p class="p List2">9) A person who does not have delegated authority
makes a commitment under a BPA.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Common Reasons for UACs</strong>.</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Failure to plan procurement needs far enough in
advance to utilize normal contracting procedures.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Encountering emergency program requirements and
not believing there is enough time to go through normal procurement
procedures.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Failure to expeditiously review, approve, and
transmit procurement requests to the Procurement Office.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Failure to perform extensive market research
before taking an action.</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) Government officials not understanding the
parameters of their actual authority or lack thereof.</p>
        <p class="p List2">6) Government official not understanding that
agreeing to an option presented by a contractor could be an
unauthorized action if it creates more work or expense.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Ratification Process</strong>. AFARS
5101.602-3-90 outlines the Army process for ratifying an
unauthorized commitment. The Government accepts liability through
ratification. When an A/OPC identifies a potential unauthorized
commitment, the A/OPC must contact the local contracting office to
initiate the ratification process.</p>
        <p class="p List1">f. <strong class="ph b">Payment of Properly Ratified Claims
with the GPC.</strong> After the UAC is ratified, the payment of
the ratified claim may be made through an appropriate contract
action (e.g., award of a contract, modification to a contract,
purchase order, GPC). After ratification, the GPC may be used to
satisfy the commitment if the amount of payment is within the
cardholder’s authority. If the outstanding charges have
already been paid in error with the GPC prior to the discovery of
the UAC, the UAC is being processed for ratification only and the
supporting documentation is loaded in the bank’s EAS.</p>

renew a contract to procure or obtain, any equipment, system, or
service that uses covered telecommunications equipment or services
as a substantial or essential component of any system, or as a
critical technology as part of any system, unless an exception

        <p class="p List1">j. <strong class="ph b">Fines</strong>. Use of the GPC to

        <p class="p List1">l. <strong class="ph b">Gift Certificates and Gift

prohibited. Gift certificates and gift cards are considered cash
advances and must not be purchased with the GPC, even to obtain
items from merchants that do not accept the GPC. As with cash and
near-cash, gift certificates and gift cards are prohibited because
they are easily misappropriated, and the award of gift certificates
or gift cards requires the submission of 1099 reports in accordance
with IRS regulations. The Army is required to file a form 1099-MISC
for payments to individuals totaling more than $600 in a tax

employees are acting as vendors).</p>
        <p class="p List1">t. <strong class="ph b">Taxes.</strong> Use of the GPC for
personal tax payments is prohibited because personal expenses
cannot be charged to the GPC. As a Federal Government entity, DoD
is exempt from paying most taxes to any other Federal, State, or
local authority. (Some states, like New Mexico, levy taxes the
Federal Government must pay.) For more information, see the GSA
State Tax Exemption Information for Government Charge Cards.</p>
        <p class="p List1">u. <strong class="ph b">Tax on Certain Foreign
Procurements.</strong> CHs will not use the GPC as a method of
payment or purchase when a contract instrument contains FAR Clause
52.229-12, unless DFARS Clause 252.229-7014 is also present. In
certain circumstances, the Government must withhold a two percent
excise tax on foreign payments to vendors to comply with the FAR
and IRS regulations. The GPC does not provide a method to
accomplish this withholding. As a result, the GPC is prohibited
from being used.</p>
        <p class="p List1">v. <strong class="ph b">Telecommunication Systems</strong>. Use
of the GPC to purchase major telecommunication systems, such as
Federal Telecommunications System or Defense Switched Network (DSN)
systems, is prohibited. A contract vehicle is required because such
purchases include special terms and conditions. DFARS 239.74
governs DoD’s acquisition of telecommunications.</p>
        <p class="p List1">w. <strong class="ph b">TikTok</strong>. In accordance with FAR
13.201(k), the prohibition in FAR 4.2202 on use of a ByteDance

        <p class="p List2">1) <strong class="ph b">Local In-person Training
Conference</strong>. Cardholders should use the GPC to pay the
registration fee. Attendance may require conference approval from
chain of command and legal office.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) <strong class="ph b">Conference that Requires Official
Travel</strong>. Cardholders may use a GPC for a standalone,

conference approval from chain of command and legal office.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) <strong class="ph b">Virtual Training Conference</strong>.
Cardholders should use a GPC to pay the registration fee.
Conference approval is not required per AR 1-50, 1-8.</p>
        <p class="p List1">g. <strong class="ph b">Food, Meals, and Refreshments</strong>.
In general, CHs may not use appropriated funds to purchase items
considered personal expenses, such as food, meals, and refreshments
without specific authority. Provided you have specific authority,
there may be limited exceptions that permit a CH to purchase food.
Additional information regarding acceptable food purchases is
available in the GAO publication, “Can Your Agency Use
Appropriated Funds for Meals and Light Refreshments?” When
purchasing food, CHs may use the GPC to buy disposable serving
materials (e.g., paper plates and napkins, plastic forks).
<strong class="ph b">Written legal and A/OPC approval is required for all food
purchases and must be included in the purchase file.</strong>
          <strong class="ph b">The below list identifies exemptions under which food may
be allowable if approved by the command and legal counsel. This
list is not all-inclusive.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="p List2">1) <strong class="ph b">Nongovernmental Meeting or
Conference</strong>. Cardholders may use GPC to pay for food if the
cost of food is a non-separable portion of a registration or
attendance fee that covers attendance and meals. CH may also use
the GPC if food is necessary to obtain full benefit of the meeting
or conference (B-233807, Aug. 27, 1990). Criteria used in
determining if an agency may pay for food for an employee attending
a nongovernmental meeting or conference:</p>
        <p class="p List3">i. Meals and refreshments are incidental to the
meeting or conference,</p>
        <p class="p List3">ii. Attendance at the meal or when refreshments
are provided is important to ensure the employees’ full
participation in the meeting or conference, and</p>
        <p class="p List3">iii. The meal and refreshments are part of a
formal conference or meeting that includes not just the meal and
refreshments and, discussions or speeches that may take place when
the meal and refreshments are served, but also substantial
functions separate from when the food is served.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) <strong class="ph b">Agency Paying for Food for an Employee
Attending a Government-Sponsored Conference</strong>. Cardholders
may use the GPC if food is necessary to obtain full benefit of the
conference and the conference involves matters of topical interest
to multiple agencies and/or nongovernmental participants. Also,
without statutory authority to charge a fee and retain the
proceeds, the host agency may not charge a registration or other
fee to defray the costs of providing food (B-198471, May 1, 1980,
and B-288266, Jan. 27, 2003). Criteria used in determining if an
agency may pay for food for an employee attending a
government-sponsored meeting or conference:</p>
        <p class="p List3">i. Meals and refreshments are incidental to the
meeting or conference,</p>
        <p class="p List3">ii. Attendance at the meal or when refreshments
are provided is important to ensure the employees’ full

refreshments and discussions or speeches that may take place when
the meal and refreshments are served, but also substantial
functions separate from when the food is served.</p>
        <p class="p List3">iv. In addition, the meeting or conference may not
be a routine meeting that involves the day-to-day operations of the
government.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) <strong class="ph b">Agency Hosting a Formal
Conference.</strong> Cardholders may use the GPC if the conference
includes registration, published substantive agenda, and scheduled
speakers; the food is a legitimate conference expense; and the
conference involves matters of topical interest to multiple
agencies and/or nongovernmental participants. Also, without
statutory authority to charge a fee and retain the proceeds, the
host agency may not charge a registration or other fee to defray
the costs of providing food (B-300826, March 3, 2005). Criteria
used in determining when an agency, as host, may pay for food at a
formal conference:</p>
        <p class="p List3">i. Meals and refreshments are incidental to the
formal conference,</p>
        <p class="p List3">ii. Attendance at the meal or when refreshments
are provided is important for the host agency to ensure
attendees’ full participation in essential discussions and
speeches concerning the purpose of the formal conference, and</p>
        <p class="p List3">iii. The meal and refreshments are part of a
formal conference that includes not just the meal and refreshments
and discussions or speeches that may take place when the meal and
refreshments are served, but also substantial functions separate
from when the food is served.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) <strong class="ph b">Light Refreshments at
Government-sponsored Conferences</strong>. The agency sponsoring
the conference may use the GPC to provide light refreshments on
breaks at Government-sponsored conferences only for Government
employees on travel orders (TDY status). Use of GPC to buy
refreshments for non-Government employees or for Government
employees not on travel orders is prohibited.</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) <strong class="ph b">Agency Hosting a Focus Group</strong>.
Cardholders may use the GPC if the focus group advances a specific
statutory mission; the participants are federal employees; and the
expenditure contributes materially to the achievement of the
specific statutory function (B-304718, Nov. 9, 2005).</p>
        <p class="p List2">6) <strong class="ph b">Routine Agency Meeting Held to Discuss
the Internal Day-to-Day Operations of the Government</strong>.
Cardholders may use GPC if the meeting is held at an outside
facility, and the cost of food is included, at no extra charge, in
the fee for the conference space (B-281063, Dec. 1, 1999).</p>
        <p class="p List2">7) <strong class="ph b">Training</strong>. Cardholders may use
GPC if participation in the meal is necessary to obtain the full
benefit of the training (39 Comp. Gen. 119 (1959)). Sponsoring
agency may serve refreshments/meals at training where the food is
necessary to achieve the objectives of the training program. The
food must be incidental to the training, and the event must meet
the definition of training in 5 USC 4101(4). Attendees would fail
to complete the training if they missed the meal.</p>
        <p class="p List2">8) <strong class="ph b">Award Ceremony</strong>. Cardholders
may use GPC if the recipients will be publicly recognized, and the
authorized agency official has determined that food advances the
recognition of the awardee. Sponsoring agency may serve light
refreshments at award ceremonies honoring individuals recognized
under a Civilian Employee Incentive Award Program. Use of GPC to
pay for refreshments at the following types of ceremonies is
prohibited: retirement, promotion, graduation, recurring quarterly
recognition, commanders’ call, PCS, and longevity (65 Comp.
Gen. 738 (1986)).</p>
        <p class="p List2">9) <strong class="ph b">Cultural Awareness Ceremony</strong>.
Cardholders may use GPC if the food is part of a formal program
intended to advance EEO objectives and make the audience aware of
the cultural or ethnic history being celebrated. The food must be a
sample of the food of the culture and be offered as part of the
larger program to serve an educational function (B-301184, Jan. 15,
2004).</p>
        <p class="p List2">10) <strong class="ph b">Official Representational Funds
(ORF).</strong> Cardholders may use the GPC to extend official
courtesies, including meals and refreshments, to authorized guests
in accordance with AR 37-47 or appropriate agency regulations. The
GPC must be dedicated solely for use of ORF expenditures. For
example, ORF may be used to purchase food in support of Employer
Support of Guard and Reserve (ESGR) for official reception,
representation, and advertising activities authorized in DoDI
7250.13, 10 USC 2241(c), and ESGROI 7000.1.</p>
        <p class="p List2">11) <strong class="ph b">Chaplain-led Programs</strong>.
Cardholders may use the GPC to buy food in support of chaplain-led
programs to assist members of the Armed Forces and their immediate
family members in building and maintaining strong family
structures. Allowable expenses include the cost of transportation,
food, lodging, supplies, fees, childcare, and training materials
for members of the Armed Forces and their immediate family members,
including participation at retreats and training conferences (10
USC 1789(b) and AR 165-1).</p>
        <p class="p List2">12) <strong class="ph b">Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program
(YRRP)</strong>. Use of the GPC may be authorized for purchases in
support of YRRP events (e.g., meals/refreshments, childcare) for
eligible individuals when the purchase is considered a
“necessary expense” in carrying out the statutory
requirement of the program established under Public Law 110-181
Section 582. See DoDI 1342.28; JTR 031902; 37 USC § 481l and
37 USC § 452(b)(15); OUSD Memo “Use of Appropriated
Funds for the YRRP” dated 7 Jul 2010; and Chief National
Guard Bureau Manual 1801.01.</p>
        <p class="p List2">13) <strong class="ph b">Recruiting Activities</strong>.
Cardholders may use the GPC for purchases in compliance with Army
Regulation (AR) 601-2, Army Recruiting Support Programs Chapter
5-2. See National Guard Regulation 601-1 para. 9-10., Army National
Guard Strength Maintenance Program. Per 10 USC <span class="ph" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_14-4__Hlk152936690"></span>§ 520c: Recruiting functions:
provisions of meals and refreshments, funds appropriated to the
Department of Defense for recruitment of military personnel may be
expended for small meals and refreshments during recruiting

        <p class="p List3">v. Other persons whose presence at recruiting
functions will contribute to recruiting efforts.</p>
        <p class="p List2">14) <strong class="ph b">Field Studies Program (FSP)</strong>.
Cardholders may use the GPC for the Field Studies Program to pay
for administrative program costs and actual event execution costs
below the micro-purchase threshold. DoD training activities may pay
for expenditures in support of the Field Studies Program IAW DoDI
5410.17, AR 12-15, SECNAVINST 4950.4B, and AFI 16–105,
including but not limited to, food and meals, supplies for
International Military Student lounges such as coffee, tea, and
condiment kits, admission to authorized venues, rental of event
space, hiring of tour guides as well as other authorized support
services during FSP field trips. See AR 12-15, Chapter
11-30a(2).</p>
        <p class="p List2">15) <strong class="ph b">Emergency Requirements</strong>. CHs
may use the GPC to purchase food in emergency circumstances where
the provision of food is incidental to the protection of human life
or Federal property (B-189003, July 5, 1977). This exception
applies in authorized emergency conditions that clearly present an
imminent danger to human life and/or destruction to federal
property and it was necessary to have employees assist in the
emergency response and/or maintain the essential functions of the
office for an extended period (53 Comp. Gen. 71 (1973) and
B189003). Emergency circumstances do not include situations where
employees are merely required to remain on duty beyond their
regular working hours, even if required to remain on duty for a
24-hour period (B-185159, Dec. 10, 1975). Further, emergency
circumstances do not include situations merely involving inclement
weather (68 Comp. Gen. 46 (1988)). Food is unauthorized in an event
where personnel were not engaged in activities to prevent imminent
danger to human life or Federal property but were only
investigating a dangerous situation which had already occurred.
Food purchases for this exception will depend on the facts and
circumstances present in each case. Occupations such as those of
policeman, firemen, security guards, are often required to be
performed under emergent and dangerous conditions and this fact
alone does not warrant departure from general rule against payment
for employees' meals from appropriated funds (B-185159, December
10, 1975).</p>

or a statement that reflects the beginning and ending date of the
subscription service. CHs must purchase mission-related
subscriptions to magazines, journals, and technical data in the
name of the agency only rather than in the name of an individual
employee. Advance payments are authorized for subscriptions to
prevent disruptions in service. Subscriptions must not have an
automatic renewal at the end of the subscription period. Before
leaving their role, CHs should notify their BO and A/OPC so that
the subscription may be cancelled or transferred to another account
as appropriate.</p>

used for individual official travel-related expenses. All
travel-related expenses (e.g., metro fares, taxi, bus fares,
automated toll tools, and parking fees) are processed in accordance
with the JTR. For travel-related expenses, the GPC may be used only
to place orders and/or make payments against contracts awarded by
warranted Contracting Officers.</p>
        <p class="p List1">q. <strong class="ph b">Vehicle-related expenses.</strong>
These expenses are generally paid with the travel or fleet cards.
CHs may use GPC when the travel or fleet card is inappropriate,
e.g., NAF and Air Force vehicles. Use of the GPC to purchase
repairs on GSA fleet-operated vehicles is prohibited.</p>
        <p class="p List1">r. <strong class="ph b">Vehicle Rental.</strong> Cardholders

      <span class="ph autonumber">14-5.</span> Split Purchases</h3>
      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. A split purchase is the intentional breaking
down of a known requirement to stay within a CH’s single
purchase limit or the MPT to avoid other procurement methods or
competition requirements. Split purchases are prohibited with the
GPC (FAR 13.003(c)(2)). Direct requirements exceeding the MPT to
the contracting office. Cardholders and A/OPCs should check with
their legal advisor if unsure whether a proposed purchase would be
considered split.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. The requirement is the total quantity and price
known at the time of purchase. If a CH purchases as they become
aware of a requirement, the requirement is each purchase. If a CH
consolidates purchases and buys once a day, the requirement becomes
what was received during that day.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. Examples of split purchases include, but are
not limited to, the following:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) A single CH making multiple purchases from the
same merchant on the same day, the total of which exceeds the
single purchase limit, and the total requirement was known at the
time of the first purchase.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) A single CH purchasing the same/similar item(s)
from multiple merchants on the same day, the total of which exceeds
the single purchase limit, and the total was known at the time of
the first purchase.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) A single CH making multiple purchases of
similar items from the same or multiple merchants over a period of
time when the total requirement was known at time of the first
purchase and the value exceeds the single purchase limit.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Multiple CHs under the same supervision or BO
purchasing the same/similar item(s) the same day or in a compressed
timeframe when the total requirement is known at a given time and
exceeds the single purchase limit.</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) Requirements exceeding the MPT (e.g.,
requirements for monthly recurring services, in which the monthly
payment is less than the applicable services MPT, but the known
yearly total exceeds the MPT).</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">What is not a Split Purchase</strong>.
Sometimes transactions appear like a split purchase, but they do
not meet the definition and are allowable to purchase with the GPC.
See common examples below:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Multiple purchases to the same vendor which do
not exceed the single purchase limit or MPT.
<strong class="ph b">Example</strong>. A CH makes two separate $100 purchases
from the same vendor on the same day. This situation is not a split
purchase because the combined total of $200 is below the MPT.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Multiple purchases to the same vendor when the
CH purchases as requirements are received.
<strong class="ph b">Example</strong>. A CH receives a $6,000 purchase request
on Monday. He obtains funding and approval and places the order. On
Wednesday, the CH receives a purchase request from the same
customer to buy additional items from the same vendor for $5,000.
He obtains funding and approval and places a second order to the
same vendor. This situation is not a split purchase, because the CH
was unaware of the second request when he made the initial
purchase.</p>

      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. The servicing bank provides Merchant
Authorization Controls (MAC) in the form of Merchant Category Codes
(MCC) and Merchant Category Code Groups (MCCG). MCCs and MCCGs
categorize merchants by the goods and services they provide. They
are used within the servicing bank’s card processing system
to authorize or decline purchase transactions based on controls
established for each GPC account. An MCC is a four-character
numeric code with a corresponding description that reflects the
merchant’s primary business. An MCCG is a logical grouping of
MCCs.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Merchant Category Code (MCC)</strong>.
A code assigned by the merchant’s bank to categorize each
merchant according to the type of business in which the merchant is
engaged and the kinds of supplies or services provided. These codes
are used as authorized transaction codes on a card/account to
identify the types of businesses providing authorized supplies or
services. DPCAP maintains the list of DoD-wide blocked MCC codes.
The servicing bank uses MasterCard’s MCCs to categorize
merchants based on the types of goods or services they provide.
When an A/OPC adds MCCs to a Cardholder or Managing Account
profile, it enables that specific account to make purchases from
vendors categorized under that MCC.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Tier 1 MCCs</strong>. The servicing
bank has placed a hard block on merchants with Tier 1 (Very High
Risk) MCCs. The bank will decline all attempted transactions from
vendors with these MCCs. Tier 1 MCCs may be unblocked upon approval
by the Level 2 A/OPC, on a case-by-case basis. All purchases from
merchants associated with Tier 1 MCCs will generate a data mining
case in IOD.</p>

      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. The GPC may be used as a payment method on
contracts. See FAR 32.1108. The Contracting Officer will make the
determination to use the GPC as the payment method for CHs to make
contract payments on formal contract vehicles up to the limit of
the Contracting Officer’s warrant when the GPC payment method
is proven to be more advantageous to the Government. Benefits to
increasing GPC contract payments include greatly increased refunds
per effort expended, exemption from GPC data mining, and faster
receipt of payments. Contracting Officers normally appoint CHs
residing in the contracting office as GPC contract payment CHs. The
Contracting Officer or an A/OPC with the appropriate delegating
authority may appoint GPC contract payment CHs outside the
contracting office providing the Contracting Officer or A/OPC with
the appropriate delegating authority provides adequate training and
oversight.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. All modifications impacting payment and/or
funding (including options exercised) must be re-coordinated with
the RM, CH, and BO to ensure the financial management system and
the bank’s EAS are properly updated. Failure to do so will
result in the servicing bank not being paid which may result in a
possible account delinquency. The CH will maintain supporting
documentation in the bank’s EAS for each contract payment
made using the GPC.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. At a minimum, procedures must be in place to
ensure proper separation of duties to safeguard Government
resources and to avoid the posting of double obligations associated
with the use of the GPC to make payment on existing contract
vehicles. Contracts where the GPC is used as the method of payment
are required to be fully funded. No progress (finance) payments are
authorized.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">FPDS-NG</strong>. Contracting Officers
are responsible for ensuring the FPDS reporting is completed. When
the GPC is used as a method of payment against a contract, the
action must be reported in an individual contract action report
(CAR), and “Yes” must be selected for “Purchase
Card as Payment Method” in FPDS. See FPDS reporting
requirements of FAR 4.6, DFARS 204.6, and DFARS PGI 204.606.
Open-market micro-purchases made with the GPC and valued less than
the MPT will not be reported to FPDS. (See FAR 4.606(c) for a list
of additional actions that are not to be reported.)</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. FAR policy requires the consent of contractors
when contemplating the use of GPC as the payment method. Consent is
typically obtained by including FAR clause 52.232-36 in the
solicitation and, if the contractor does not object, the contract.
Existing contracts may be modified to include the clause, with the
consent of the contractor. The GPC may be used as a contract
payment method if the vendor accepts the payment.</p>
        <p class="p List1">f. <strong class="ph b">Contract Payment Processes</strong>.
The servicing bank has two different methods for contract payments:
a payment card process and a Payment Plus process. See paragraph
15-4 and Figure 15-1 for a description of the payment card process.
See paragraph 15-5 and Figure 15-2 for a description of the Payment
Plus process.</p>

officer</p>
        <p class="p">will insert the FAR clause 52.232-36, Payment by Third Party, in
solicitations and contracts. Payment by a purchase card may also be
made under a contract that does not contain the clause at
52.232-36, to the extent the contractor agrees to accept that
method of payment. When the clause at 52.232-36 is included in a
solicitation or contract, the contracting officer will also insert
the clause at 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds
Transfer—Central Contractor Registration, or 52.232-34,
Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer—Other Than Central
Contractor Registration, as appropriate. The contracting officer

        <p class="p List1">a. Wide Area Workflow must be utilized when making
contract payments with the GPC per DFARS 232.7002, 232.7003, and
252.232-7003. The contractor must use WAWF to create the purchase
card receiving report (PCRR) when the GPC is used as a method of
payment. The CH provides the following information to the
contractor to submit PCRR into WAWF:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Vendor Identifier: Vendor/Company Name</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Payment Office: CRCARD</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Ship to:</p>

        <p class="p List2">6) Card Issuing Bank ID: 556862</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. The contractor then uses WAWF to create and
submit the PCRR. Upon notification that the goods have been
received, the Government acceptor accepts the PCRR in WAWF. The CH
verifies that acceptance has occurred in PIEE/WAWF and that the
contracting officer has approved the invoice. The CH submits the
invoice, receiving report, copy of the contract and modifications,
and a current obligation/disbursement sheet to the BO for approval.
After acceptance of the property in WAWF, data will flow to the
Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) based on the Pay
DoDAAC<em class="ph i">.</em> Indicating “CRCARD” as the payment
office prevents double obligation and data from entering the
payment process.</p>

concur or non-concur with the waiver request to the ODASA(P) CPM.
If JPEO-A&amp;A concurs with the request and the request justifies
inclusion in the AFARS Appendix EE list of approved exceptions to
policy, the ODASA(P) will approve the waiver request. If
JPEO-A&amp;A non-concurs with the waiver request, JPEO-A&amp;A will
return the request with a non-concurrence to the requesting
organization. If the waiver request is approved by the ODASA(P),
the activity will be authorized the exception to policy in
compliance with Army policy.</p>

      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. A/OPCs have several reporting tools that enable
them to manage their purchase program effectively through the
bank’s EAS. Most electronic reports are updated within two to
three days after a transaction. However, some reports are only
updated at the end of the billing cycle. A/OPCs will have access
through the EAS to monitor account holder transactions at any time.
By searching by account holder name or account number, A/OPCs can
track account holder transactions (e.g., transactions, payments,
disputes), as well as view account holder monthly statements.
A/OPCs may also contact the bank’s customer service at any
time to request information on a specific account.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. Program metrics will be implemented in each
contracting office to provide the SCO, A/OPCs, and key Army
officials with an assessment of the risk environment and feedback
as to whether card programs are satisfying overall strategic goals.
All A/OPCs will utilize the reports identified in Table 17-1 and
17-2 to review performance metrics and identify any systemic
deficiencies requiring corrective action(s).</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. A/OPCs should maximize utilization of reports
available on the GPC Business IT systems web sites such as the IOD
and AXOL. The reports can assist with conducting periodic and
annual surveillance inspections along with overall GPC Program
management. Many reports are available through the servicing
bank’s EAS, IOD, and PIEE system to assist A/OPCs in the
management and oversight of the GPC program. In addition to
reviewing these reports, A/OPCs at all levels should perform and
maintain certain metrics to assess the performance of their
program. These metrics include, but are not limited to, the
following:</p>

socioeconomic program provides employment opportunities for over
40,000 Americans who are blind or have other severe disabilities by
orchestrating Government purchases of products and services
provided by nonprofit agencies employing such individuals
throughout the country. The Committee for Purchase from People Who
Are Blind or Severely Disabled statute, (41 USC 8501-8506) requires
the Government to purchase supplies or services on the Procurement
List, at prices established by the Committee, from AbilityOne
participating nonprofit agencies if they are available within the
period required.</p>
      <p class="p">
        <strong class="ph b">Abuse</strong> - Intentional use of the GPC in violation
of the FAR, DFARS, Agency supplements, or activity Government
Charge Card Program policies/procedures. Evidence of intentionality
will be inferred from repeat offenses of the same violation,

Intentional.</p>
      <p class="p">
        <strong class="ph b">Accountable Property</strong> - AR 735-5 - A term used
to identify property recorded in a formal property management or
accounting system. Accountable property includes all property
purchased, leased (capital leases), or otherwise obtained having a
unit acquisition cost of $5,000 or more (land, regardless of cost),
and items that are sensitive. Sensitive items require a high degree
of protection and control due to statutory requirements or
regulations, such as narcotics and drug abuse items; precious
metals; items which are of a high value, highly technical, or a
hazardous nature; and small arms, ammunition, explosives, and
demolition material or classified. (See Volume 10, Table 61 of DoD
4100.39-M reference (k).) Additional and/or separate records or
other record-keeping instruments will be established for management
purposes, or when otherwise required by law, policy, regulation, or
agency direction, including, but not limited to pilferable items.
Pilferable items have a ready resale value or application to
personal possession and are, therefore, especially subject to
theft. Screening by the Accountable Property Officer (APO) is
required to determine the accounting requirements of the purchased
property. The installation APO provides guidance on specific local

        <strong class="ph b">Receipt</strong> - A receipt is a written record of a
transaction documenting proof of payment. The receipt acts as the
title to the property obtained in the exchange. A receipt is a
legal document which serves as a permanent record of the

receipts. Many online businesses provide the cardholder with the
option of printing a receipt of the transaction as soon as the
payment is approved. In addition, the vendor may provide the
cardholder with an <a class="xref" href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-email.htm" target="_blank">email</a> copy of

        <strong class="ph b">Third-party Payments</strong> – An online payment
processor (e.g., PayPal, Square) provides ways for a merchant to
accept credit cards and other payments online without the extra
cost and obligation of a merchant account. Where it is identified
that a purchase will be processed via a third-party merchant (i.e.
PayPal), the CH should make every attempt to choose another
merchant with whom to procure the goods and/or services. If still
found necessary to procure using a third-party payment merchant,
the CH and BO must ensure there is adequate supporting
documentation to prove that there was a detailed review of the
purchase and that the use of the third-party payment merchant was
unavoidable.</p>
      <p class="p">Transactions made with a third-party payment merchant are
considered high risk for both subsequent audit and data mining
screening.</p>
