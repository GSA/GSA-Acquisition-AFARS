If the authority cited is substantial duplication of costs, then paragraph 5 should compare the duplicate costs the government would incur to create competition and the estimated savings expected to be recovered through subsequent competition. In addition, the justification must include an explanation for how the requesting office derived their estimates and why they believe they are a substantial duplication. Justifications citing unacceptable delays must identify firm schedule limitations that do not result from a lack of planning. For example, firm schedule limitations could include an approved Army campaign plan or significant loss of life or property.</p>

If the delay associated with the requirement for first article testing is the principal reason for not awarding the contract on a full and open basis, clearly describe the reasons why first article testing is required and why other quality assurance techniques are inadequate. Contracting officers may submit J&amp;As citing this authority for approval after the contract has been awarded (see FAR 6.302-2(c)(1)).</p>

Subsection 1244(a)(2) of the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (NDAA FY2023), implemented in DPC Class Deviation 2023-O0003 REV 2, provides that a “covered contract” may be presumed to be in the public interest.
