            Buying gift certificates and cards is generally prohibited.
            Exception: Gift certificates and gift cards are considered to be
            cash advances and must not be purchased with the GPC, even to obtain
            items from merchants that do not accept the GPC. As with cash and
            near-cash, gift certificates and gift cards are prohibited because
            they are easily misappropriated and the award of gift certificates
            or gift cards requires the submission of 1099 reports in accordance
            with IRS regulations. The Department is required to file a form
            1099-MISC for payments to individuals totaling more than $600 in a

            for Payment of Travel Related Expenses.” Only the travel card is to

            automated toll tools, parking fees) are processed in accordance with
            the Joint Travel Regulations (JTR) Chapter 2, Part L. The JTR
            provides examples with formulas (e.g., ordinary travel miles to
            permanent duty station, miles to other sites, cost of fares) to
            determine whether the Government is responsible for the travel
            expense.</p>
