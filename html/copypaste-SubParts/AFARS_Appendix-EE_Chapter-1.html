      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-1___1-1._Overview">a. The Army Federal
Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFARS) Appendix EE provides
policy guidance and procedures for the management of the Army
Government Purchase Card (GPC) program. It implements and
supplements sections of the Department of Defense (DoD) Government
Charge Card Guidebook for Establishing and Managing Purchase,
Travel, and Fuel Card Programs (hereinafter referred to as the DoD
Charge Card Guidebook). In the event of a conflict between DoD
policy and Army policy, DoD policy takes precedence. In the event
of a conflict between Army policy and command policy, Army policy
takes precedence over any less-restrictive command policy. These
operating procedures neither supersede nor take precedence over
more-restrictive Army command procedures. This document applies to
all purchases utilizing Army-issued GPCs.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. Refer recommended changes and questions about
the AFARS Appendix EE to the Office of the Deputy Assistant
Secretary of the Army (Procurement) (ODASA(P)). Submit requests for
waivers through the chain of command. Compliance with the AFARS
Appendix EE is mandatory.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. The GPC program provides Army and supported
organizations a simplified, streamlined method of purchasing and
paying for supplies, services, construction projects, and contract
payments. The program complies with Federal, DoD, and Army
statutory and regulatory guidance, as well as the terms and
conditions specified in the most current General Services
Administration (GSA) SmartPay® 3 Master Contract. The primary
benefit of the GPC Program is that the card-issuing banks provide a
commercial purchase and payment service that replaces the
paper-based, time-consuming purchase order process; reduces
procurement lead time; provides transaction cost savings; reduces
procurement office workload; provides refunds; and facilitates
payment to include reductions in interest payments.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. The AFARS Appendix EE provides the procedures
to use within the Army, including Army National Guard (ARNG) and
Air National Guard (ANG), to establish and manage the Army GPC
program. Army activities may supplement (i.e., adopt more stringent
internal control requirements than the requirements cited herein),
but not change this policy. However, as these are risk-managed
programs, activities should maintain a proper balance between the
control environment and ease of use to ensure that the benefits of
the card continue to accrue. These procedures establish Army-wide
standards designed to provide all Army activities with a foundation
upon which to build specific standard operating procedures
governing their programs.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. Nonappropriated Fund (NAF) activities implement
policies and procedures governing the Army’s Morale, Welfare,
and Recreation programs and regulations for Nonappropriated Fund
Instrumentalities (NAFI). Chaplaincy activities implement policies
and procedures governing Army Chaplain Corps activities. Army
NAFIs/entities must operate within the parameters of these
procedures to include Public Health Command (PHC) NAFIs, Department
of Defense Education Activities (DoDEA) NAFIs, and Army National
Guard NAFIs. NAF activities will comply with the Department of
Defense Policies and Procedures Governing Non-Appropriated Funds
SmartPay® 3 Government-wide Commercial Purchase Card Use
– SP3 Transition Memorandum #11. Non-appropriated funds
(NAF)-funded GPCs issued under SmartPay3 must be properly
segregated for oversight. All NAF GPC Cardholder (CH) accounts must
be established under separate managing accounts (MAs). Commingling
of appropriated and non-appropriated funded cards under a single MA
is strictly prohibited.</p>

(Card/Cardless).</strong> The GPC may be used to purchase
fixed-price commercial supplies and services that do not require

micro-purchase threshold (MPT).</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Micro-purchases (Convenience
Check).</strong> Convenience checks may be used and set up under a
separate billing official (BO) account to buy commercially

issued for each convenience check account.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Orders Against Pre-Existing Contract

blanket purchase agreement. (Appropriated fund CHs cannot purchase
against nonappropriated fund contracts.)</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. <strong class="ph b">Contract Payments.</strong> The GPC may
be used to make payments against funded contracts found to be
advantageous to the Government when compared to other methods of
payment, and the contractor accepts payment by the GPC. The
contract should include the third-party payment clause identified
in FAR 32.1108, Payment by Governmentwide Commercial Purchase Card;
however, GPC contract payments may be made if the contractor agrees
to accept the GPC as a method of payment.</p>

direct the question to the Oversight Agency/Organization Program
Coordinator (OA/OPC) (Level 3 A/OPC). If the OA/OPC cannot resolve
the issue, the OA/OPC should consult the Component Program Manager
(CPM) (Level 2 A/OPC) for guidance. GPC personnel should coordinate
with their local legal counsel as necessary.</p>

      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. GPC programs require procurement authority to
operate and cannot be established or maintained unless procurement
authority is granted in accordance with governing laws and
regulations and delegated through a contracting activity identified
in Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS)
Procedures, Guidance, and Information (PGI) 202.101 and the DoD
Charge Card Guidebook. Contracting authority flows from authorities
granted in Titles 10 and 41, United States Code (10 and 41 USC)
from DoD to the Secretary of the Army to the Heads of Contracting
Activities (HCAs). The HCA re- delegates contracting authority to
local procurement offices. The Senior Contracting Official (SCO) or
Chief of Contracting Office (CCO) may re-delegate their GPC
procurement authority listed in Table 1-3 to OA/OPCs or A/OPCs for
OA/OPCs and A/OPCs to appoint cardholders and convenience check
account holders through the Delegation of Contracting Authority
Letter produced in the Joint Appointment Module (JAM) within the <a class="xref" href="https://piee.eb.mil/xhtml/unauth/home/login.xhtml" target="_blank">
            <u class="ph u">Procurement
Integrated Enterprise Environment (PIEE)</u>.</a> See sections 1-8
and 5-1 for more information. Cardholders must countersign to
acknowledge this responsibility.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. The Joint Appointment Module (JAM), an
application within PIEE, is the mandatory enterprise tool for
appointing and delegating authority to GPC personnel.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. Orientation and training are prerequisites to
receiving GPC delegated authority via an appointment in JAM.
Training requirements are listed in Chapter 4.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. Generally, only a government employee can be a
cardholder or billing official. National Guard traditional members
and State employees should not be CHs or BOs. The following
exceptions apply:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Foreign nationals may be appointed as CHs only
if they are direct-hires working for the U.S. Government. However,
commanders/directors should consider the potential consequences of
appointing foreign nationals as CHs in countries where Status of
Forces Agreements (SOFAs) or local laws do not subject the foreign
national employee to the same pecuniary or general financial
liability or disciplinary actions for charge card violation as U.S.
citizens.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC)
instructors are members of the Armed Forces in accordance with
USACC Regulation 145-2, section 4-2, and may be designated micro-
purchase procurement authority as GPC cardholders. See FAR
1.603-3(b).</p>

      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-6___1-6._Applicability">a. These procedures
apply to all GPC purchases with cards and convenience checks issued
by the Army. Non-Army tenant organizations issued Army GPCs or
convenience checks by an Army contracting office are also subject
to these procedures. All BOs, CHs, A/OPCs, Resource Managers (RMs),
Logisticians, and other stakeholders participating in the Army GPC
program are subject to these procedures, including any non-Army
tenant organizations where the Army has contracting authority and
oversight responsibilities (such as ANG units).</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. The ODASA(P) has overall responsibility for the
Army GPC program. Each Army command, organization, or activity
utilizing Army GPCs has the responsibility for the following
actions:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Provide adequate resources and effective
internal controls to ensure the appropriate management, operation,
training, and oversight is in place to operate a local GPC program
effectively and efficiently in compliance with Army policies and
procedures.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Establish and maintain a command climate to
prevent Army personnel or others from exercising undue influence
over the actions of an A/OPC, BO or CH.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Take appropriate informal and formal
disciplinary actions in the event of noncompliance, fraud, misuse
and/or abuse. Disciplinary actions should be based on the severity
and frequency of the infraction and can range from informal actions
such as written or verbal counseling, to demotion, removal, loss of
security clearance, or potential criminal prosecution.</p>

        <p class="p List1">a. <strong class="ph b">Micro-Purchase Cardholder</strong>.
This authority allows CHs to use the GPC to buy commercially
available, fixed-price supplies and services to fulfill
mission-essential requirements. The maximum single transaction
dollar limit for stand-alone purchases is the MPT as defined at FAR
2.101.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. <strong class="ph b">Micro-Purchase Convenience Check
Writer</strong>. This authority allows CHs to use a GPC convenience
check to buy commercially available, fixed-price supplies and
services to fulfill mission- essential requirements. Since
convenience checks expose the Government to greater risk, CHs must
make every effort to use a GPC card before writing a check. CHs may
only use this authority when use</p>
        <p class="p">of the GPC is not possible. All check purchases must be within
the applicable convenience check MPT. DoD FMR Volume 10, Chapter 23
establishes the financial management policy for convenience check
accounts.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. <strong class="ph b">Micro-Purchase Emergency-Type
Operations (ETO) CH and/or Check Writer</strong>. This authority
allows CHs to buy commercially available, fixed-price supplies and
services to fulfill mission-essential requirements in direct
support of a declared contingency or emergency event. The ETOs
currently included in 41 USC 1903 are:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Contingency Operations as defined in FAR
2.101;</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Operations to facilitate the defense against or
recovery from cyber, nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological
attack against the United States as addressed in FAR 18.001;</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Operations in support of a request from the
Secretary of State or the Administrator of the United States Agency
for International Development to facilitate the provision of
international disaster assistance as addressed in FAR 18.001;
and</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Operations to support response to an emergency
or major disaster as defined in Section 102 of the Robert T.
Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 USC

implemented in

FAR 26.2). </p>
        <p class="p" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-8___2rrrqc1">The group term “ETO” also includes humanitarian or
peacekeeping operations (as defined in FAR 2.101). Currently, when
supporting humanitarian or peacekeeping operations in accordance
with FAR 2.101, the MPT does not increase, regardless of whether
the humanitarian or peacekeeping operation is taking place inside
or outside the United States; and the SAT can increase to $500,000
upon determination by the HCA that the respective supplies or
services directly support the humanitarian or peacekeeping
operation. FAR 18.2 addresses Emergency Acquisition Flexibilities
(EAFs). It is critical to verify whether increased EAFs have been
authorized for the particular ETO being supported. If so, each HCA
has the authority to authorize use of EAFs. </p>
        <p class="p List1" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_1-8__Table_1-4_Emergency-Type_Operations">d. <strong class="ph b">Warranted
Overseas ETO Cardholder.</strong> This authority allows CHs to use
the GPC in conjunction with their separately issued SF 1402
Certificate of Appointment to purchase supplies and services as
prescribed in DFARS 213.301(3). Contracting officers may use this
authority to make purchases up to the applicable simplified
acquisition threshold in support of declared contingency or
emergency events.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Contract Ordering Official.</strong>
This authority allows CHs with the appropriate training to issue
fixed- price orders against existing contracts (e.g., GSA FSS,
BPAs, FedMall contracts, CHESS contracts) to fulfill
mission-essential requirements for supplies and services valued up
to the Contract Ordering Official single purchase limit and to use
the GPC to pay for these orders/purchases. When using this
authority, CHs must 1) ensure they are authorized to place orders
by the contract terms and conditions, 2) ensure the order will
comply with all the contracts terms and conditions, and 3) follow
all applicable ordering procedures. When ordering above the MPT, CH
should obtain pricing from small business when small business can
meet the requirements. The CH should obtain quotes from at least
three sources. If restricting competition to fewer than three
sources, the CH should document the circumstances in the purchase
file. CHs with this designation will be referred to as
“Ordering Officials” throughout this document. The <a class="xref" href="https://armyeitaas.sharepoint-mil.us/:b:/r/sites/ASA-ALT-PAM/Documents/Army%20Ordering%20Officer%20Guide%20v.1%20(Feb%202024).pdf" target="_blank">Army
Ordering Officer Guide</a> standardizes procedures for selecting,
appointing, and terminating ordering officers in accordance with
AFARS 5101.602-2-92 and provides guidance for appointed
individuals. This guide is to be utilized in conjunction with AFARS
Appendix EE.</p>
        <p class="p List1">f. <strong class="ph b">Overseas Simplified
Acquisition</strong>. This authority allows CHs to make authorized
GPC purchases up to a single purchase limit of $25,000 when the CH
is outside the U.S. for items/services to be used outside the U.S.,
and that comply with the requirements of DFARS 213.301(2). When
ordering above the MPT, the CH should obtain quotes from at least
three sources. If restricting consideration to fewer than three,
document the circumstances in the purchase file.</p>
        <p class="p List1">g. <strong class="ph b">Contract Payment Official.</strong>
This authority allows CHs to use the GPC to make payments against
contracts that have been signed by a Contracting Officer when the
GPC is named as the payment method. The GPC may provide a
streamlined way of paying for contracts when a contracting officer
determines the use of the GPC is in the best interest of the
Government (AFARS 5113.202-90(d)).</p>
        <p class="p List1">h. <strong class="ph b">Miscellaneous Payments Official (SF 182
Training Payments).</strong> This authority allows CHs to make
payments for commercial training requests using the SF 182, valued
at or below $25,000 in accordance with the procedures to directly
pay the provider in DoD FMR Volume 10, Chapter 12, Section 120323,
and DoDI 1400.25, Volume 410a. The SF 182 or equivalent must be
completed prior to the training. When provided by a non-Government
source, the training must consist of a regularly scheduled,
commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) course, training conference, or
instructional service that is available to the public and priced
the same for everyone in the same category, e.g., price per
student, course, program, service, or training space.</p>
        <p class="p List1">i. <strong class="ph b">Inter/Intra-Governmental Payment
Official.</strong> This authority allows CHs to make payments to
another Federal Government entity in lieu of using a MIPR or
Inter-Governmental Payment and Collection (IPAC) in accordance with
the DoD FMR. This authority includes, but is not limited to,
payments to DLA Document Services, U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA)-offered training, GSA Global Supply, Commissary, and FedMall
GPC requisitioning. (Purchases from State and Local governments are
considered traditional open-market micro-purchases and therefore
are covered by the applicable authority listed above.) Special
requirements for this authority include the following:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) The not-to-exceed value is dictated by TFM
Volume 1, Part 5, Chapter 7000, Section 7055.20.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Federal Government entities must limit their
credit card collections so that individual transactions are no more
than $10,000, which is the daily GPC credit limit for third-party
purchases. The Treasury encourages use of IPAC for payments between
Federal Agencies, debit cards, Automated Clearing House (ACH)
debits/credits, and Fedwire transactions.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Card acceptance policies can be found in TFM
Volume I, Part 5, Chapter 7000, which addresses limitations on
credit card transactions.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) IGTs exceeding $10,000 must be made with an
alternative payment method (e.g., IPAC for payments between Federal
Agencies, debit cards, ACH debits/credits, and Fedwire
transactions).</p>
