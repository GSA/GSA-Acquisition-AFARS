      <span class="ph autonumber">10-1.</span> Policy and Use</h2>
      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. Convenience checks provide activities with the
flexibility to issue checks for payment of supplies and services to
support mission needs when the vendor doesn’t accept payment
by GPC. The Army does not receive refunds or retain dispute rights
on convenience check purchases. The authority to maintain a
convenience check account will be justified on an individual basis.
The number of convenience check accounts per installation must be
kept to a minimum. Convenience check accounts are available only to
organizations that maintain active GPC accounts in good
standing.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. Convenience checks must not be used to avoid
the normal GPC payment process. Before a check is issued, the
paying agency must make every effort to use the GPC, including
making maximum efforts to find and use merchants that accept the
GPC. Before writing a convenience check, the checkwriter must
obtain an IRS Form W-9 to ensure possession of all information
required for tax form issuance.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. DFAS recommends not writing checks to foreign
vendors. When writing a check to a foreign vendor, an IRS Form W-8
is required before payment. To determine which W-8 form is used,
see IRS Publication 515, Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens
and Foreign Entities. To determine if tax withholding and tax
deposits to the IRS are required, see IRS Publication 515,
Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Entities
and/or IRS Publication 901, U.S. Tax Treaties.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. If a U.S. vendor refuses to provide their TIN
and it is a tax reportable payment, the checkwriter will choose
another vendor.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Restrictions</strong>.</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Checkwriters must not use checks for employee
reimbursements, cash advances, cash awards, travel-related
transportation payments, or meals.</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Convenience check purchases must not require
detailed specifications or an inspection report.</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Convenience checks should not be used for
recurring payments.</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Convenience checks must not be used as a method
of payment against existing contract instruments.</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) Checks will not be issued as an
“exchange-for-cash” vehicle to establish cash funds. If
merchants issue credits or refunds by cash or check, the funds must
be immediately credited to the account against which the purchase
was originally made.</p>
        <p class="p List2">6) The same purchase prohibitions that apply to
the GPC apply to convenience checks.</p>
        <p class="p List1">f. <strong class="ph b">Micro-purchase Threshold</strong>. The
MPT for convenience checks is half the open market and contingency
MPT per Section 806 of Public Law 115-91. See Table 1-2. Splitting
payments across multiple checks is prohibited if the total
requirement will exceed the applicable convenience check MPT.
Checkwriters may use checks for purchases in support of declared
contingency events up to the applicable convenience check MPT.</p>
        <p class="p List1">g. <strong class="ph b">Processing Fee</strong>. Convenience
checks must be written for the exact payment amount. The payment
amount for a check does not include the servicing bank’s
administrative processing fee. The check processing fee is added by
the servicing bank during processing of the transaction, and the
addition of the processing fee is not considered a split
requirement. Checkwriters should ensure that the total funds
obligated include both the payment amount and the processing fee.
The convenience check MPT is for the payment amount of the good or
service, which does not include the processing fee (e.g., a check
may be written up to $5,000; the processing fee is accounted for
separately and is charged separately on the billing statement).</p>
        <p class="p List1">h. <strong class="ph b">Security and Oversight</strong>.
Convenience checks are negotiable instruments and must be stored in
a locked container, such as a safe or locking filing cabinet.
Checks must be accounted for appropriately to prevent loss, theft,
or potential forgery. Review convenience check accounts annually.
Accounts with checks written above the allowable limit will be
subject to suspension or termination. Commands with oversight
responsibility will consider cancellation of convenience check
privileges of cardholders who improperly use convenience checks
(e.g., exceeding the convenience check limit).</p>
        <p class="p List1">i. Convenience checks are pre-numbered, and their
use is controlled with a separate convenience check purchase log
for each account. Check purchases are reconciled just as other GPC
transactions, as part of the monthly statement billing cycle in the
servicing bank’s EAS. Retain copies of voided checks in the
bank’s EAS as part of the file documentation.</p>
        <p class="p List1">j. <strong class="ph b">Disputes</strong>. The normal GPC
dispute process is not applicable to convenience checks. Concerns
over a check purchase must be resolved directly with the merchant.
The checkwriter is responsible for securing credits or resolving
problems with the merchant. Each organization is responsible for
all checks written on an account, unless it is determined fraud is
involved. In some cases, payments can be stopped on a convenience
check that has been written if the check has not yet been posted to
an account. To stop payment on a check, the checkwriter must call
the servicing bank’s customer service department to receive
instructions on processing the action.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">10-2.</span> Establishing a Convenience Check
Account</h2>
      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. Convenience check accounts are dedicated
accounts and must be maintained separately from the GPC account.
Cardholders may have both a regular GPC account and a separate
convenience check account. Payee information on the convenience
check must be <strong class="ph b">written legibly</strong>. Convenience checks
are not to be used for recurring payments.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. Any U.S. Government employee, military or
civilian, including local national employees, may be selected for
appointment as a checkwriter. Traditional part-time National Guard
members cannot be checkwriters. Contractors working for the Army
cannot be checkwriters.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. Requests to establish convenience check
accounts must be justified in writing by the organization and
forwarded to the Level 4 A/OPC. Required information must consist
of the following:</p>
        <p class="p List2">1) Justification for the account</p>
        <p class="p List2">2) Types of vendors to receive checks</p>
        <p class="p List2">3) Estimated dollar amount of checks to be written
within a 12-month period</p>
        <p class="p List2">4) Single and monthly purchase limits</p>
        <p class="p List2">5) Checkwriter’s complete name, office name,
address, email, phone/fax number</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. Checkwriters must be appointed in PIEE/JAM with
the “Micro-Purchase Convenience Check Writer”
designation. The checkwriter is the only person who has the
authority to issue and sign checks.</p>

1099)</h2>
      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">a. The DFAS Tax Office is responsible for DoD
compliance with 1099 reporting requirements.</p>
        <p class="p">DFAS provides the convenience check payment data to the
applicable A/OPC and checkwriter for determining the tax reporting
requirements and completion of specifically identified data not
available to, or captured by, the contracted bank. The checkwriter
is responsible for ensuring the completion and return of the data
to DFAS.</p>
        <p class="p List1">b. The Army is required to file a Form 1099-MISC
for payments to vendors or individuals totaling more than $600 in a
tax year.</p>
        <p class="p List1">c. 1099 reporting involves the collection of
Personally Identifiable Information (i.e., Taxpayer Identification
Number and Social Security Number) and must be safeguarded with
appropriate oversight controls in accordance with the Privacy
Act.</p>
        <p class="p List1">d. IRS Form 1099 must be issued to check
recipients for certain payment types. (See <a class="xref" href="https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1099mec" target="_blank">

          </a> for more detail regarding
payment types that are not reportable to DFAS.) Convenience check
data must be reported to the IRS as income to the check
recipients.</p>
        <p class="p List1">e. <strong class="ph b">Tax Reporting</strong>. The DFAS Tax
Office emails convenience check purchasing data monthly to the
checkwriters for verification. The email contains a spreadsheet,
instructions, and the suspense date for return. Upon receipt of the
spreadsheet, checkwriters must update the required columns and
email the spreadsheet to the following mailbox, <a class="xref" href="mailto:dfas.cco-checks@mail.mil" target="_blank">
            <u class="ph u">dfas.cco-checks@mail.mil</u>

          </a>,

          </a>.</p>
        <p class="p">Checkwriters will obtain the vendor information and W-9 required
for tax reporting before paying the vendor, as stated in DoD
7000-14R FMR 26 Volume 10, Chapter 6, 060209. The checkwriter is
responsible for tax reporting for the convenience checks they issue
and for obtaining a signed IRS Form W9, Request for Taxpayer
