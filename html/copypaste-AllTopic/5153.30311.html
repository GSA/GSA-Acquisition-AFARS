      <p class="p List2">1. Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. section 3207(a)(7), as implemented in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-7, full and open competition need not be provided for when the head of the agency determines that it is not in the public interest in the particular procurement concerned. Subsection 1244(a)(2) of the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (NDAA 2023), implemented in Class Deviation 2023-O0003, provides that a “covered contract” may be presumed to be in the public interest. A “covered contract” is any contract, subcontract, or modification of a contract, or subcontract awarded by the Department of Defense to:</p>
      <p class="p">□ build the stocks of critical munitions and other defense articles of the Department</p>
      <p class="p">□ provide materiel and related services to foreign allies and partners that have provided support to the Government of Ukraine </p>
      <p class="p">□ provide materiel and related services to the Government of Ukraine</p>
      <p class="p List2">2. Pursuant to AFARS <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="5106.3027.html">5106.302-7 Public Interest.</a> and Appendix GG, the head of agency authority has been delegated to <em class="ph i">(identify delegate).</em>

      <p class="p List2">3. Army Contracting Command – <em class="ph i">(insert awarding contracting office) </em>on behalf of Program Executive Office <em class="ph i">(insert the responsible PEO)</em> plans to award a contract for <em class="ph i">(insert brief description)</em>. The planned contract is a “covered contract” because <em class="ph i">(insert succinct explanation as to how it meets the above criteria)</em>. </p>
      <p class="p List2"> 4. As a “covered contract” the planned award may be presumed to be in the public interest. Application of that presumption to this procurement expedites contract award and thereby advances important DoD and national objectives related to Ukraine support.<em class="ph i">(add other pertinent consideratio</em>

      </p>
      <p class="p List2"> 5. The contracting activity will ensure compliance with the seven (7)-day congressional notification requirement, under NDAA 2023, subsection 1244(a)(2)(B)(iii), prior to making award.</p>
