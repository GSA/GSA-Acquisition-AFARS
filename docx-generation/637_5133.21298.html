Under certain circumstances, the Army can convert settlement agreements in Disputes statute cases before the ASBCA into consent judgments to access the Judgment Fund to pay for settlements.  In Disputes statute cases before federal courts where Department of Justice represents the Army, the Department of Justice may use its independent authority to use the Judgment Fund for settlements.  Contracting officers should consult with their legal counsel and their local resource management office prior to taking any actions related to the use of the Judgment Fund.  Only authorized officials of a federal agency may submit a request for payment from the Judgment Fund.  Requests submitted by anyone other than an authorized federal official are deemed fraudulent.  Filing a false or fraudulent claim constitutes a Federal offense that is punishable by fines, imprisonment, or both.  (See 31 U.S.C. 3729 and 18 U.S.C. 287.)  The authorized official for Army is the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Financial Management and Comptroller).  See Appendix GG for further delegation.  Army contracting activities shall follow the policy set forth in this section of the AFARS.</p><p TCE:source="p" TCE:Parent="conbody" TCE:outputclass="List2" class="List2 ">(2)  The Army must reimburse the Judgment Fund with funds current as of the date of the judgment.  According to the Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation, (DoD FMR), Volume 3, Chapter. 8, paragraph 080304F.5, approval authority is required from the cognizant Assistant Secretary of the Military Department (Financial Management and Comptroller) or Defense Agency Comptroller for all Judgment Fund Reimbursements to the Department of the Treasury in excess of $1,000,000.</p><p TCE:source="p" TCE:Parent="conbody" TCE:outputclass="List1" class="List1 ">(b)  <em TCE:source="i" TCE:Parent="p">Fiscal considerations in settlements.  </em>If funds appropriate to pay a settlement are expired but the account remains open, contracting officers must use expired funds to pay the settlement.
