      <p id="HdQrxe" outputclass="List1">c. For TIAs which use payable milestones, has the agreements officer included a term or condition in the award document or otherwise required the recipient to maintain in an interest-bearing account any payable amounts received in advance of needs to disburse the funds for program purposes, unless one of the following conditions applies:</p>
      <p id="kxHSGp" outputclass="List2">1. The recipient receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per year;</p>
