   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-1__FjpiEf">a. This section provides specific management controls required of GPC programs, guidelines for disciplining abusers, and other control information. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-123, Appendix B, provides additional guidance on implementing strong internal controls. PCOLS is designed to both maintain the integrity of these controls and validate their effectiveness in safeguarding Government resources. Management officials are responsible for establishing a process of internal controls that is (1) designed to provide reasonable assurance that the GPC program is used efficiently, effectively, and legally to achieve the purpose for which the program was established and (2) is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-1__KFvHaS">b. Required Management Controls include:</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-1__OWIAFN">(1) <strong class="ph b">Maintain Purchase Log:</strong> All CHs are required to maintain either an electronic or a manual log (if not electronically enabled) for each transaction made using the card.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-1__qKEwdH">(2) <strong class="ph b">Maintain Positive System of Funds Control</strong>
         <strong class="ph b">:</strong> Spending limits (such as monthly and office limits) are tied directly to the funding allocated for each card account (monthly, quarterly, and semiannually). Fund limits should be consistent with historical spending patterns to minimize Government exposure and ensure adequate funds availability. This provides an overall control to ensure funding is available prior to purchases being made with the card.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-1__huCfMV">(3) <strong class="ph b">Ensure Separation of Duties</strong>
         <strong class="ph b">:</strong> For the GPC, a mandatory management control is the separation of duties. Key duties such as making purchases (CH), verifying purchases are proper (A/BO), authorizing payments (BO and FSO), certifying funding (Finance and Resource Managers), independent acceptance for accountable property, and reviewing and auditing functions (A/OPC and Property Book Officers) must be assigned to different individuals to the greatest extent possible to minimize the risk of loss to the Government.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-1__GcMVJW">(4) <strong class="ph b">Reconciliation/Approval by the CH</strong>
         <strong class="ph b">:</strong> During each billing cycle, CHs are required to reconcile the CH statement they receive from the issuing bank against the purchase card log they are required to maintain for card purchases.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-1__PtSLZF">(5) <strong class="ph b">Reconciliation/Approval by the A/BO:</strong> After the CH has approved his/her entire CH statement, he/she forwards the electronic or hard copy file to the cognizant A/BO. The A/BO is required to approve or reject each purchase made by the CHs under his/her hierarchy. When the A/BO has completed their review of each invoice submitted for his/her card accounts, the A/BO, acting in the role of Certifying Officer, can certify the entire invoice as legal, proper, and correct in accordance with his/her responsibilities.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-1__pjgjpQ">(6) <strong class="ph b">Exercise Dispute Authority</strong>
         <strong class="ph b">:</strong> The CH has 60 days from the date of the billing statement to dispute the transaction.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-1__ZFfvmO">(7) <strong class="ph b">Exercise/Maintain Authorization Controls:</strong> Appropriate spending limits and Merchant Category Code (MCC) access are tailored to each CH account. Spending limits and MCC access should reflect historical buying patterns/trends.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-1__MRrHSD">(8) <strong class="ph b">Systems Access Security:</strong> Appropriate safeguards must be in place to control issuance and safeguarding of access credentials to the EAS.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-1__WJocDB">(9) <strong class="ph b">Available Funding Integrity:</strong> Certified lines of accounting (LOAs) must be traceable through disbursement. All changes to LOAs must be documented and certified.</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-1__ogBzBR">(10) <strong class="ph b">Invoice Integrity:</strong> An electronic certification process ensures the original electronic invoice is traceable from the vendor through the certification and entitlement processes and retained in a Government record. Should the original invoice submitted by the contractor be in paper form, the Certifying Officer shall determine if the invoice is proper for payment and affix his/her signature in accordance with the governing provisions of the <a class="xref" href="http://comptroller.defense.gov/fmr/05/05_33.pdf" target="_blank">
            <u class="ph u">DoDFMR</u>
         </a>. If appropriate, the Certifying Officer makes any required “pen and ink” changes on the original invoice to reallocate the payment to different funding lines from those reflected on the original invoice. The Certifying Officer determines whether these changes are proper and affix his/her signature with the standard certification language on the original paper invoice.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">4-2.</span> Surveillance Reporting and Surveillance Reviews</h2>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-2__mouajY">a. The Level 4 A/OPC must conduct a review of 100% of BO accounts annually to include a minimum representative sample size of 25% of transactions for each BO account. The A/OPC should utilize PCOLS Data Mining/Risk Assessment (DM/RA) reviews, transactional reports from the Bank’s EAS (or other electronic oversight process), DoD Checklist and Certification Template (appendix D), and the Formal Reporting Requirements Template (Appendix G) to perform the review.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-2__GLUMrL">b. Reviews may be conducted in person, remotely, or electronically depending on the size, complexity, and past review history of the BO account. Reviews should focus on transaction activity and overall adherence to the purchase card program requirements, as well as provide a response to previous findings and recommendations and resulting corrective actions taken. Results of the review should be documented and briefed to the BO and the BO's supervisor detailing findings, discrepancies, issues, and/or identifiable trends.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-2__aDfQvP">c. In conjunction with reviewing all BO accounts annually, the Level 4 A/OPC is responsible for drafting a semi-annual surveillance report and providing it to the Level 3 A/OPC (due April 21st and October 21st). The report should address all aspects of the activity’s GPC program, including BO/CH account/transaction reviews; appointment and account issuance/maintenance; GPC usage requirements; GPC documentation, processing, and financial requirements; convenience check writer requirements; and training.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-2__IGRrUd">d.In reporting BO/CH account and transaction data, the review should include the following: at least 25% of transactions based on a representative sample of data, inclusion of high risk transactions as flagged in Access Online and PCOLS, and transactions from every BO and CH account. The semi-annual surveillance report must thoroughly analyze and summarize all items addressed in the DoD Checklist and Certification Template (Appendix D) and the Formal Reporting Requirement Template (Appendix G). The report should be all-inclusive as to provide a clear, precise representation of the agency GPC Program and its daily operations.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-2__rHIhrt">e. Level 3 A/OPCs must conduct semi-annual reviews of all Level 4 Programs within their oversight and must provide a formal semi-annual report (due May 1 and November 1) to the Army Level 2 A/OPC. The report should provide the results of the surveillance programs for their prospective organization, should summarize repetitive or systemic weaknesses by activity, and should address all aspects of a surveillance plan. The surveillance report should provide a detailed summary of the reports provided by his/her respective Level 4 A/OPCs. The report must be drafted and presented to the Level 2 A/OPC using the template found at Appendix H which summarizes all aspects of the GPC Program, consistent with the DoD Checklist and Certification. All area of the template should be fully analyzed, discussed, and supported with metrics, concrete examples and evidence that a surveillance plan was implemented and surveillance conducted throughout the reporting period.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-2__AHvmiW">f. The Level 2 A/OPC will provide an Army-wide GPC Semi-annual surveillance report describing the Army GPC Program. The report will identify trends, corrective actions, and dates for implementing changes throughout the GPC community to support identified program trends, strengths and weaknesses. The Level 2 A/OPC may interview Level 3 and/or Level 4 A/OPCs to gain further insight into GPC trends across the Army GPC program and may perform a separate random sample review of GPC transaction to determine whether or not identified trends are substantiated.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-2__sAlxNR">a. Review reports must be maintained on file for six years and three months. Repeat findings from the previous fiscal year review report may result in suspension of your account.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-2__BLUwFo">b. Convenience check and FDC accounts shall be reviewed quarterly by a disinterested party and not the BO of the convenience check account or A/OPC.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-2__LclGPm">c. Reports of surveillance reviews must provide information to each management level, which identifies repetitive problems and systemic weaknesses at the individual and organizational levels.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-2__SguzWN">d. A/OPCs, BOs, and CHs must use PCOLS to assist and monitor the use of the GPC</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-2__4o9xo5fl">e. The Army shall use PCOLS as an electronic tool for managing its GPC program.See section 4.4 for a description of PCOLS. PCOLS enables A/OPCs to conduct oversight and surveillance of an organization’s GPC program utilizing PCOLS reporting capabilities. By clicking on the “PCOLS Reporting” section upon logging into the PCOLS website, the A/OPC is able to run various reports based upon her/her role in PCOLS. These reports assist the A/OPC in identifying GPC program trends and strengths and weakness and should be monitored and used in conjunction with conducting GPC surveillance. The Army GPC Program Office will utilize PCOLS reporting capabilities to decipher the overall health of the GPC Program and to validate finding of each agency’s semi-annual surveillance and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) report findings.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">4-4.</span> Purchase Card Online System (PCOLS)</h2>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-4__lktkqM">a. PCOLS is a DoD-wide suite of electronic systems that GPC officials use to improve the management and accountability within their GPC program organizations. PCOLS is comprised of five applications: Enterprise Monitoring and Management of Accounts (EMMA), Authorization, Issuance, and Maintenance (AIM), PCOLS Reporting, Data Mining (DM), and Risk Assessment (RA). PCOLS is Common Access Card (CAC) enabled to ensure secure authentication and nonrepudiation. Due to enhancement of program oversight, the Purchase Card On-Line System (PCOLS) is mandated for GPC participants Army-wide and accessible at: <a class="xref" href="https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/appj/pcols-web/" target="_blank">
            <strong class="ph b">
               <u class="ph u">https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/appj/pcols-web</u>
            </strong>
            <u class="ph u">/</u>
         </a>.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-4__gCtZvD">b. <u class="ph u">EMMA</u> is used to capture and define organizational purchase card hierarchies, document authority chains, and identify relationships among purchase card roles. EMMA increases the accuracy of personnel data and institute more robust inclusion of supervisors (e.g., cardholder and managing account supervisors). EMMA acts to electronically define the GPC hierarchy, the roles within the hierarchy, and assigns individuals to those roles. Additionally, EMMA enables the A/OPC to alter or remove any personnel from assigned roles reflecting changes to hierarchy structures, also known as provisioning.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-4__GphuTV">c. <u class="ph u">AIM</u> is used to initiate, approve, and transmit requests for GPC issuance and maintenance actions. AIM draws from hierarchies (e.g., role responsibilities and permissions) established in EMMA. It directly engages GPC supervisors, helps ensure business rules comply with internal organizational management controls, and is a workflow tool performing various GPC Program account authorization and maintenance functions.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-4__psItaF">d. <u class="ph u">Data Mining (DM)</u> programmatically reviews 100% of the DoD purchase card transactions using sophisticated intelligent/learning software and identifies correlations, patterns, and trends in purchase card buying actions. This transaction review allows daily, near-real-time mining of the data. The Case Manager, which is an integral component of DM, interprets the referred transactions and creates specific cases that are assigned to the Approving/Billing Officials (A/BOs) for review. Through the use of the Case Manager Interview Process, the A/BO demonstrates that due diligence is exercised in the review of the referred transactions. With this DM tool, scarce human resources can be targeted on identified high-risk transactions and maintain a record of actions taken on referred transaction reviews for improved internal audit ability of the program.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-4__yBeZYF">e. <u class="ph u">Risk Assessment (RA)</u>, together with results from the DM Application, assess and report on the overall "health" of a DoD organization's purchase card program. RA allows users to monitor risks associated with their purchase card program. Users assess the risk of their purchase card program by monitoring certain risk controls on a cycle-by-cycle basis. This monitoring is accomplished through the following components within the RA Application: controls, dashboards, and quarterly reports.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-4__p__Toc212456300">f. PCOLS automatically un-provisions, or removes users from their PCOLS roles in EMMA when their retirements or separations are reported to the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS). DEERS receives personnel information updates from the DoD services and agencies on a regular basis.</p>
      <p class="p" id="AFARS_Appendix-EE_4-4__qsZVHx">g. As discussed in Section 2-2, PCOLS users are responsible for completing DAU GLG005, Purchase Card Online System (PCOLS) prior to GPC appointment and GPC account issuance. DAU GL 005 provides comprehensive role-based PCOLS training and assists in understanding how to utilize the preceding applications in providing oversight of your GPC Program.</p>

      <p class="p Normal">If, as a result of findings from a surveillance visit, or by any other means, the A/OPC discovers a CH or BO has violated GPC procedures, the A/OPC shall document the violation and take action to resolve the noncompliance to include, if necessary, retraining of the CH or BO and/or temporarily suspending the CH or BO’s GPC privileges. Any determinations to cancel or permanently suspend a CH or BO account shall be made by the Level 2 A/OPC, CCO or designee (e.g. Level 3 or 4 A/OPC), and their findings forwarded to the CH or BO’s supervisor.  Continual violation of GPC procedures by an individual CH or BO shall result in termination of GPC privileges. A/OPCs shall verify that all potentially fraudulent and erroneous transactions that have been identified are disputed and properly resolved.  Evidence of deliberate abuse shall be referred to the CH’s and/or BO’s Commander by the CCO for appropriate action in accordance with the Uniform Code of Military Justice or civilian disciplinary rules. Evidence of fraud or other criminal activity shall be referred, by the Commander/CCO, to the appropriate investigative body (e.g. Office of the Inspector General (OIG), Army Audit Agency (AAA)) or other investigative body for a follow up investigation.  The violation and action taken shall be documented in the A/OPC’s files.</p>
